MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
A court of general jurisdiction has a statutory as well as an inherent duty and power to 
control its own processes and orders so as to make them conform to justice, including the 
granting of a stay of execution.  Code of Civil Procedure Section states in pertinent part: “(a) 
Every Court shall have power: . . . (8) To amend and control its processes and orders so as to 
make them conform to law and justice.” CCP §128(a). This was confirmed in Revolution 
Eyewear, Inc. v. Aspex Eyewear, Inc. (2009), 2009 U.S. LEXIS 64749, wherein the court stated 
that “The district court has the inherent power to control and manage its docket, which includes 
the authority to order a stay pending the outcome of reexamination proceedings.” Id at 9. 
Here, the court has authority to grant a stay to enable Defendant(s) sufficient time to 
present and argue the underlying Motion to Set Aside the Default, Vacate the Judgment, and 
Recall the Writ of Execution.  If the stay is not granted, Defendant(s) will be locked out without 
an opportunity to present the motion.  As the attached Motion shows, Defendant should have the 
right to have this eviction case heard on its merits.  Therefore, the stay should be granted.

I.
THE COURT MAY SET ASIDE A JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO CCP § 473(b)
WHEN ENTERED AGAINST A DEFENDANT DUE TO HIS/HER MISTAKE,
INADVERTENCE, SURPRISE OR EXCUSABLE NEGLECT
California's Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) states:
The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party . . . from a 
judgment . . . taken against him or her through his or her mistake, 
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  Application for this relief . . . 
shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months. 
CCP § 473(b) is a remedial statute and should be liberally construed to carry out the 
policy of permitting trials on their merits.  See Faasuyi v. Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167

Cal.App.4th 681, 695 quoting McCormick v. Board of Supervisors (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d. 352 
(internal citations and quotations omitted).  Absent prejudice to the Plaintiff and diligence by the 
Defendant, only “very slight” evidence is needed to set aside a default.  Id.  The standard is if 
the act or omission is one that a reasonably prudent person would commit under the same 
circumstances.  See Transit Ads, Inc. v. Tanner Motor Livery, Ltd. (1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 275, 
279. Fraud by a third party, physical incapacity or death in the family can cause excusable
neglect.  See Shapiro v. Clark (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1128; see also Gamet v. Blanchard (2001) 
91 Cal.App.4th 1276 and Sullivan v. Sullivan (1967) 246 Cal.App.2d 301. 
II.
THE COURT MAY SET ASIDE A DEFAULT AND DEFAULT JUDGMENT
UNDER CCP § 473.5 WHEN PROPER SERVICE DOES NOT RESULT IN
ACTUAL NOTICE IN TIME TO DEFEND THE LAWSUIT
California Code of Civil Procedure § 473.5 states:
(a) When service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to
defend an action . . . [Defendant] may serve and file a notice of motion to set aside the
default . . . within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of:  (i) two
years after entry of a default judgment . . . (ii) 180 days after service on him or her of a
written notice that the default or default judgment has been entered.
(b) A notice of motion to set aside a default . . . shall be accompanied by an affidavit
showing . . . that the party's lack of actual notice . . . was not caused by his or her
avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect.
Cal. Civ. Proc. § 473.5.  The purpose of this law is to allow cases to be decided by trials on 
their merits.  Id.  The Defendant has not received “actual notice” unless he/she has personally 
received or personally viewed the Summons and Complaint by one of the service methods 
specified under Code of Civil Procedure sections 415.10 et. seq.  See Tunis v. Barrow (1986) 
184 Cal.App.3d 1069, 1077.

THE COURT MUST SET ASIDE A JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO CCP § 473(d)
AND THE COURT'S EQUITABLE POWERS UNDER CCP § § 128(a)(8) and
86(b)(3) WHEN IT IS VOID FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.
If legal papers are not served in strict compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections
415.10 et. seq., a judgment is void as the Court lacks jurisdiction.  See Ellard v. Conway (2001) 
94 Cal.App.4th 540; see also Rochin v. Pat Johnson Manufacturing Co. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 
1228, 1239.  One may file to set aside a judgment that appears void on its face by a review of the 
judgment roll at anytime.  See Cal. Civ. Proc. §§ 473(d), 128(a)(8), 86(b)(3); see also Hayashi v. 
Lorenz (1957) 42 Cal.2d 848, 851.  However, one must file to set aside a judgment within the 
two year limit specified under Cal. Civ. Proc. § 473.5 if the judgment appears valid on its face 
but is void for lack of jurisdiction.  Rogers v. Silverman (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1114, 1121-1122.  
IV.
THE COURT MAY SET ASIDE A JUDGMENT AT ANYTIME USING ITS
EQUITABLE POWERS UNDER CCP § § 128(a)(8), 86(b)(3) WHEN A 
JUDGMENT IS ENTERED BASED ON EXTRINSIC FRAUD AND/OR
MISTAKE, AND, IN LIMITED CIVIL CASES, INADVERTENCE AND/OR
EXCUSABLE NEGLECT
The Court has inherent equitable powers to set aside a judgment obtained by extrinsic
fraud and/or mistake to ensure its orders conform to justice.  See Cal. Civ. Proc. §§ 128(a)(8).  In 
limited civil cases, the Court may also consider inadvertence and excusable neglect.  See Cal. 
Civ. Proc. §§ 86(b)(3).  Such fraud and/or mistake includes most external circumstances 
depriving a party of a fair trial, such as the other party filing a false proof of service.  In re 
Marriage of Park (1980) 27 Cal.3d 337, 342; see also Sullivan, supra, 256 Cal.App.2d 304.   
In default cases, there is a 3-part test for relief; whether there is/was: 1) a meritorious 
case--do the facts, if proven, create a possible different result (not required if not required if 
improper or lack of service); 2) a valid reason for not defending the original case; and, 3) 
diligence (ordinary care in the situation) used in requesting to set aside the default once

discovered.  Rappleyea v. Campbell (1994) 8 Cal.4th 975; see also Shapiro v. Clark (2008) 164 
Cal.App.4th 1128, 1144; see also McCreadie v. Arques  (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 39, 46.  The 
Court also considers any possible prejudice that could result from the set aside.  Munoz v. Lopez, 
(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 178, 183. 
V.
CONCLUSION
The Court should set aside the default and judgment and quash any writ of possession
and/or execution in the interest of due process and fairness.  Defendant should be able to 
properly defend the case and have it decided by a trial on its merits.
