DEFAULT JUDGMENT CHECKLIST 
CLERK DEFAULT JUDGMENT – CIVIL 
Use this checklist to complete your default judgment prior to filing it with the court. The Default Judgment Checklist is intended to 
provide a guideline to properly file your Proof of Service, Request for Entry of Default and Clerk Default Judgment.  
A clerk may enter a default judgment in a written obligation (e.g., contract or promissory note) action only if the amount due is set forth 
in the contract or may be determined from the terms of the agreement. The action must state the amount due in the written agreement 
or must be easily determined without taking evidence. Examples of case types that are typical of a Clerk Default Judgment include: open 
book accounts (credit cards), bad checks, accounts stated based on statements, and promissory notes for money owed, and collection 
cases.  
A clerk default judgment may be obtained when the defendant fails to file a response to the summons and complaint within the time 
specified on the summons. Even if the defendant fails to file a response, you will not obtain a default judgment if the named defendant 
has not been properly served, the party names do not match the names on the complaint or on any subsequent amendments to the 
complaint, or there are other technical defects such as omitting a signature.  
This information is intended as a guide to assist you in processing your default judgment. 
1.
Proof of Service. Use Judicial Council form POS–010. A sheriff or process server may use a similar form that
complies with California Rules of Court, rule 2.150.
A separate Proof of Service of Summons must be used for each defendant served.  
The name of the party served is the same as the defendant or cross‐defendant named in complaint or 
in any subsequent amendment.  
Indicate the name and title of the person authorized to accept service on behalf of a business/entity.  
If substituted service method was used on a natural person, a Declaration of Due Diligence must be 
attached to the Proof of Service. 
If service is done by Notice and Acknowledgment of Receipt – Civil (POS‐015), file the Proof of Service 
of Summons (POS‐010) along with the signed Notice and Acknowledgment of Receipt – Civil. 
2.
Request for Entry of Default. Use Judicial Council form CIV‐100.  This form specifies which sections are
required to be completed to obtain default only, or to obtain default and apply for a default judgment. The
default cannot be entered if any of the following exists:
The time for the defendant to respond, as specified in the summons, has not expired. 
An answer, demurrer, notice of motion to strike any part of the pleading, notice of motion to transfer, 
notice of motion to dismiss, notice of motion to quash service of summons or to stay or dismiss the 
action, or notice of filing a writ of mandate.  (Code of Civil Procedure section 585(a)—(c))  
The POS‐010 does not indicate the defendant was properly served. 
If any of the following exists, the default of defendant may not be entered:   
The names of the defendant(s), including “aka’s”, are not the same as the names on the complaint or  
any amendment. 
Proof of service of Statement of Damages  (Judicial Council form CIV‐050) has not been filed when the 
complaint is for Personal Injury or Wrongful Death action. 
Proof of service of statement of damages has not been filed when the complaint is requesting punitive 
damages.  Do not use Judicial Council for CIV‐050 for this type of statement. (Code of Civil Procedure 
section  425.115).

Clerk Default Judgment. Use Judicial Council form JUD‐100.
*Note: If a statement of damages was required, you must proceed with a Court Default Judgment.
Any damages, prejudgment interest, attorney fees, costs or other monetary amounts, if requested, must be
stated 1) in the prayer of the complaint, and 2) must be specified on the Request for Entry of Default form
(page 1, section 2). The clerk will not calculate the amounts for you.
Use Judicial Council form CIV‐110 – Request for Dismissal, to dismiss any named or doe defendants 
not stated on the judgment.  
Costs claimed on the judgment: 
If the case could have been filed in Small Claims Court , you may apply to the court to have costs allowed 
as part of the judgment.  
If the case could not have been filed in Small Claims Court (e.g., assigned claim), submit a declaration 
stating that the demand letter was mailed to the defendant, notifying them that they are liable for court 
costs (Code of Civil Procedure section 1033).   You must apply to the court to have costs allowed as part 
of the judgment.  
  Interest claimed on the judgment: 
Interest is allowed at the legal rate unless the contract allows for a higher rate. This must also be 
specified in the prayer of the complaint. If the amount exceeds the legal rate, the original contract must 
be filed with the court.  
Attorney Fees claimed on the judgment: 
Attorney fees claimed must comply with any schedule provided for by local court rules.  
If attorney fees are allowed by a specific statute, such as Civil Code section 1717, et seq., this must be 
specified in a separate declaration or specified in the prayer of the complaint.  
If attorney fees are based on a written agreement, this must be stated in the prayer of the complaint. 
The original contract must be filed with the court.  
Written Agreement:  
Submit the original contract or a copy of the contract with a declaration why the original contract 
cannot be submitted.  This must be filed when requesting attorney fees in accordance to the 
agreement or when requesting interest that is more than the legal limit. You can help expedite your 
judgment by highlighting the agreement for attorney fees and any interest claimed that exceeds the 
legal amount. In most instances, the legal amount is 10%. 
Fee Waiver has been granted for prevailing party:  
The judgment must include all fees that were waived by the court. Any costs collected must be paid to 
the court.  
4.
Basics to check or include before submitting your document to the court.
Is each document and declaration dated and signed?  
If you are not eFiling or filing by FAX, each document submitted must be an original unless you have 
applied to the court to accept a copy in lieu of the original.  
Did you include a self‐addressed, stamped envelope of sufficient size and with sufficient postage for 
the clerk to return your file stamped copies to you?

Plaintiff/Petitioner:
Defendant/Respondent:
NOTICE TO PERSON SERVED 
WRIT OF EXECUTION OR SALE. Your rights and duties are indicated on the accompanying Notice of Levy (form EJ-150).  
WRIT  OF  POSSESSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY. If the levying officer is not able to take custody of the property, the levying 
officer will demand that you turn over the property. If custody is not obtained following demand, the judgment may be enforced as a 
money judgment for the value of the property specified in the judgment or in a supplemental order.  
WRIT OF POSSESSION OF REAL PROPERTY. If the premises are not vacated within five days after the date of service on the  
occupant or, if service is by posting, within five days after service on you, the levying officer will remove the occupants from the real  
property and place the judgment creditor in possession of the property. Except for a mobile home, personal property remaining on the 
premises will be sold or otherwise disposed of in accordance with CCP 1174 unless you or the owner of the property pays the 
judgment creditor the reasonable cost of storage and takes possession of the personal property not later than 15 days after the time 
the judgment creditor takes possession of the premises.  
EXCEPTION IF RENTAL HOUSING UNIT WAS FORECLOSED. If the residential property that you are renting was sold in a 
foreclosure, you have additional time before you must vacate the premises. If you have a lease for a fixed term, such as for a year, you 
may remain in the property until the term is up. If you have a periodic lease or tenancy, such as from month-to-month, you may remain 
in the property for 90 days after receiving a notice to quit. A blank form Claim of Right to Possession and Notice of Hearing (form 
CP10) accompanies this writ. You may claim your right to remain on the property by filling it out and giving it to the sheriff or levying 
officer. 
EXCEPTION IF YOU WERE NOT SERVED WITH A FORM CALLED PREJUDGMENT CLAIM OF RIGHT TO POSSESSION. If you 
were not named in the judgment for possession and you occupied the premises on the date on which the unlawful detainer case was 
filed, you may object to the enforcement of the judgment against you.  You must complete the form Claim of Right to Possession and 
Notice of Hearing (form CP10) and give it to the sheriff or levying officer. A blank form accompanies this writ. You have this right 
whether or not the property you are renting was sold in a foreclosure.

Your Next Steps
Find out if you need to pay a fee for service by asking the court’s self-help center, a lawyer, or the sheriff’s office. 
Here are some situations where you do not need to pay for service: 
If you have a fee waiver in your case (fee waiver granted by a judge on form FW-003 or FW-005). 
If you are serving a domestic violence, elder abuse, or gun violence restraining order. 
If you have a civil harassment, workplace violence, or school violence restraining order based on a credible threat of
violence or stalking.
Give this form and a copy of all the court papers you need served to the sheriff or marshal, including a copy of a fee 
waiver (if you have one). If you do not have to pay a fee to the sheriff, you can send your papers electronically. If you 
have to pay a fee, contact the sheriff to find out your options for turning in your request. Note that you can always turn
in your request in person.
You should get a form back from the sheriff. 
If the sheriff was able to serve your court papers, you should receive a form (called a proof of service). Make sure 
you get a copy from the sheriff and file it with the court. Note that if there is a court stamp at the top right corner 
of the first page, it has already been filed and you do not need to file it with the court. 
If the sheriff was unable to serve your court papers, you should receive a form (sometimes called declaration of due 
diligence) that tells you that service was unsuccessful and will give details about when the sheriff tried to serve the 
person. If the sheriff was unable to serve your papers, you can ask a lawyer or court’s self-help center about your 
next steps.
To find your local court self-help center, go to www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp. Self-help center staff will not act as your 
lawyer but may be able to give you information to help you decide what to do in your case. Services are free.
