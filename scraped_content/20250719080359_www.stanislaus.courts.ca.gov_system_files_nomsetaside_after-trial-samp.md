MOTION TO SET ASIDE JUDGMENT AFTER TRIAL 
 
This packet of forms is to request a Set Aside of a Default and Vacate a Judgment in an Unlawful 
Detainer (Eviction) case.  If you did not previously file an Answer, a “Proposed Answer” must be filed 
along with the motion to set aside the default.   
 
NOTE: In order to be eligible to request that the Court set aside the Default and 
Judgment, you must be able to meet both of these requirements: 
a) Be able to show good cause for not filing and Answer or for not appearing in court for the        
trial, and  
b) Be able to show that you had a defense to the underlying eviction. 
 
Step-by-Step Instructions 
 
1. GIVE 24-HOUR NOTICE: You must give the Plaintiff or the Plaintiff’s Attorney 24 hour’s prior notice 
of your intent to seek an order to Set Aside the Default and Vacate the Judgment.  You do this by 
contacting the Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s Attorney by telephone and stating:   
 
“I will be submitting a request to Set Aside the Judgment twenty-four hours from the 
time of this call.”   
 
NOTE:  Remember the DATE & TIME of the call and the RESPONSE (if any) received 
from the Plaintiff or their attorney, because this information is required for the request. 
 
2. PREPARE THE DOCUMENTS: Complete the following documents: 
 
Ex Parte Motion 
 
Declaration 
 
Points and Authorities 
 
Order on Motion 
 
Ex Parte Application for Order Shortening Time  
 
3. FILING YOUR DOUCMENTS:  Take the original and 2 copies (copies will be made for you if you have a 
fee waiver on file) to the Clerk’s office for filing.  The Clerk will file-mark the documents and set a 
HEARING DATE. There will be a filing fee due at the time of filing unless you qualify for a Fee Waiver.  
You can get a Fee Waiver packet from the Clerk’s Office or the Self Help Center.  If you qualify for a 
Fee Waiver, the Clerk’s Office will make the copies for you. 
 
4. SERVING DOCUMENTS:   A copy of the documents must be given to the Plaintiff or Plaintiff’s 
Attorney, prior to the time of the hearing.  Someone other than you must HAND DELIVER a copy of 
the DOCUMENTS to the Plaintiff or the Plaintiff’s Attorney.  They must be over 18 years old and 
CANNOT be you or anyone else living in the home or named as a defendant in the lawsuit.  Once 
they deliver a copy of the documents to the plaintiff or plaintiff’s attorney have them complete, 
date and sign a PROOF OF SERVICE. 
 
(Cont’d on Page 2) 
FILE the Proof of Service with the Clerk’s Office, if possible, otherwise bring it with you to the 
hearing.  Be sure to attend the hearing. 
 
5. CHECK THE TENTATIVE RULING: The court will issue a Tentative Ruling announcement on the court 
day prior to your hearing date.  
 
If the Tentative Ruling in your case is satisfactory, you need not appear at the scheduled time, the 
ruling becomes final. However, if you are not satisfied with the Tentative Ruling, and wish to appear 
and argue the matter, YOU MUST NOTIFY the Clerk’s Office and the opposing party of your intent 
before 4:00 p.m. THE DAY BEFORE YOUR HEARING. 
You may request a hearing by calling the calendar line at (209) 530-3162 or the main line at (209) 
530-3100, prior to 4:00 p.m. OR by e-mailing at civil.tentatives@stanct.org.  Email requests must be 
made prior to 4:00 p.m. AND confirmed by return e-mail. If you do not receive confirmation e-mail 
from the clerk, you MUST call (209) 530-3162 to request your hearing.  If you fail to notify the Clerk’s 
Office of your request for hearing, the court will not allow you to argue the merits of your motion at 
the hearing. 
 
The tentative ruling announcement is posted on the court’s website at www.stanct.org after 1:30 
P.M. THE DAY BEFORE THE HEARING.  If you do not have access to a computer to check the ruling on 
the website, you may call the court directly ater 1:30 p.m. at (209) 530-3162 to obtain the tentative 
ruling (Monday-Thursday only). 
 
6. ORDER:  If the Judge grants the stay, the courtroom clerk will notify the Sheriff’s Office and the 
Clerk’s office will fax a copy of the signed order to the Sheriff’s office once signed by the Judge.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
1. 
THE COURT MAY RELIEVE A PARTY FROM A JUDGMENT TAKEN 
AGAINST HIM THROUGH HIS MISTAKE, INADVERTENCE, SURPRISE 
OR EXCUSABLE NEGLECT 
Code of Civil Procedure §473 specifies the procedure by which a party may apply to the 
court for relief from a default entered through mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable 
neglect of the party or the party’s attorney. 
C.C.P. §473 also empowers the court to set aside any default judgment that is void as a
matter of law.  Rogers v. Silverman (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1114, 1121 [265 Cal.Rptr.286]; Reid 
v. Balter (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1186 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 287, 292]. In the case at bar, the court
never acquired personal jurisdiction over the defendant since the summons and complaint were 
not served on the defendant by actual or substituted service.  There, the judgment is void as a 
matter of law.  Se Munoz v. Lopez (1069) 275 Cal.App.2d 178 [79 Cal.Rptr.563] 
Courts have repeatedly held that C.C.P. § 473 applies to judgments entered after trial for 
failure to appear. Bodin v. Webb (1936) 17 Cal.App.2d 422 [62 P.2d 155]. 
2. 
C.C.P. §473 MUST BE CONSTRUED TO PREVENT INJUSTICE AND
ENSURE THAT EACH CASE IS HEARD ON ITS MERITS.
California courts have repeatedly stressed the need for liberal construction of C.C.P. §473 
to ensure the fullest and fairest presentation of each case on its merits.  All doubts should be 
resolved in favor of the moving party.  As the court stated in Rosthenal v. Garner (1982) 142 
Cal.App.3d 891, 898 [191 Cal.Rptr.300, 304]: 
It is also well established that it is the policy of the law to bring about a trial on 
the merits whenever possible, so that any doubts which may exist should be 
resolved in favor of the application, to the end of securing to a litigant his day in

court and a trial upon the merits . . . Even in a case where the showing under 
section 473 is not strong, or where there is any doubt as to settling aside of a 
default, such doubt, should be resolved in favor of the application. 
3. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, defendant urges that the motion to set aside the default and 
vacate the judgment thereon and to recall and quash any writs of execution be granted.
