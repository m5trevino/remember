LIVE-IN CAREGIVERS FOR  
TENANTS WHO ARE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES 
 
 
This article was developed by the Fair Housing Partners of Washington to educate 
persons with disabilities about requesting reasonable accommodations for live-in 
caregivers.  
 
WHAT IS A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION?  
 
The Federal Fair Housing Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act, the Washington State Law Against Discrimination, and local fair 
housing laws require that housing owners and managers provide reasonable 
accommodations for applicants and residents who have disabilities. Reasonable 
accommodations are changes in rules, policies, practices, or services that are 
necessary for a person with a disability to have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a 
dwelling. Allowing tenants who have disabilities to utilize the assistance of live-in 
caregivers is a reasonable accommodation. 
 
WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF DISABILITY? 
 
Under fair housing laws, a person is considered to be disabled if s/he has a sensory, 
mental or physical condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities 
(such as walking, seeing, hearing, working, etc.). The state law definition includes 
disabilities that are temporary or permanent, common or uncommon, mitigated or 
unmitigated.  
 
DEFINITION OF LIVE-IN CAREGIVER1 
 
Although there is no definition of a live-in caregiver in the fair housing laws, regulations 
for HUD-subsidized housing provide a useful definition. Using the HUD regulations as 
guidance, a live-in caregiver may be defined as a person who resides with a person(s) 
with disabilities2 who is:  
 
(a) essential to the care and well being of the person(s);  
(b) not obligated to support the person(s) with the disabilities; and  
(c) would not be living in the unit except to provide the necessary supportive 
services. 
 
Although a live-in caregiver is an occupant of the unit, the caregiver is not considered a 
tenant for the purpose of income qualification and is not liable for paying rent. Because 
a live-in caregiver only lives in the unit for the purpose of providing supportive services 
for a person with a disability, the caregiver has no right to continue living in the unit if the 
tenant with the disability moves out.  
                                            
1 HUD uses the term “live-in aide.” 
2 Residents of HUD-subsidized housing who are elderly or near-elderly also may request live-in aides. For 
more information about this, contact the housing authority or HUD-assisted property owner. 
HOW DO I REQUEST PERMISSION FOR A LIVE-IN CAREGIVER? 
 
If you need the assistance of a live-in caregiver, make a request to your landlord or 
manager for a reasonable accommodation. It is best to submit such requests in 
writing, but verbal requests are acceptable. Sample letters can be found at the end of 
this article. 
 
Can a housing provider verify that a live-in caregiver is necessary? 
 
Yes. Housing providers are entitled to verify: 
 
• 
the existence of the disability if it is not readily apparent,  
• 
the need for the accommodation if it is not readily apparent, and 
• 
that the caregiver is qualified to provide the supportive services that are needed 
because of the disability.   
 
If your landlord or manager asks for this verification, you should obtain a signed letter 
from your doctor or other medical professional, or other qualified third party who, in their 
professional capacity, has knowledge about your disability and your need for the 
caregiver. You do not have to provide details about your disability or about the 
specific supportive services that the caregiver will provide.  
 
NOTE:  A verification letter stating that the caregiver would be “nice” or “helpful” is 
insufficient.  
 
What if I just need a care attendant? 
 
A care attendant is a person that regularly visits the unit to provide supportive or 
medical services but does not live in the unit.  
 
Because care attendants do not occupy the unit, a reasonable accommodation request 
should not be necessary and screening is generally not appropriate. While a housing 
provider may have a policy to conduct screening of everyone who works for residents, 
such a policy may have fair housing implications because it would likely impact people 
with disabilities more than others. However, it would be reasonable for the housing 
provider to request that a care attendant verify that s/he has a separate residence. If a 
tenant utilizes a company that provides in-home care services, the tenant can provide 
verification from the company that its employees do not reside in the unit. 
 
A care attendant who occasionally spends the night in the unit is probably not going to 
be an issue under most rental agreements. However, it is a good idea to check your 
rental agreement to see how it defines guests. In many cases, a care attendant who 
spends more than two weeks a year sleeping in the unit may be considered a live-in 
caregiver. 
 
Can apartment management require live-in caregivers to be screened?   
 
A housing provider may require live-in caregivers to be identified and to undergo some 
screening. If a housing provider screens live-in caregivers, the screening should be 
limited to appropriate areas. For example, it may be appropriate to screen a caregiver 
for a criminal record if the landlord’s policy is to conduct criminal background checks for 
all adult applicants. But it is not necessary to screen the caregiver for the ability to pay 
the rent, because a caregiver is not obligated under the lease.  
 
Housing providers can deny residency to a live-in caregiver who refuses to be identified 
or consent to limited screening. 
 
It is always a good idea to request permission from the landlord before the caregiver 
moves in. If there is an emergency and you have an immediate need for a live-in 
caregiver and the housing provider’s policy is to screen all live-in caregivers, the 
landlord may allow you to hire the caregiver, and then screen the caregiver following the 
hiring. While this practice entails some risk, the risk is low if the caregiver is paid and 
screened by a company or the state. 
 
What if my caregiver is a relative? 
 
There is no rule against a relative being your live-in caregiver provided the caregiver is 
essential to your care and well being, not obligated to support you, and would not be 
living in the unit except to provide the necessary supportive services. If your live-in 
caregiver is a relative, it would be reasonable for a landlord to follow HUD’s policy of 
requiring the relative to sign a statement prior to moving into the unit relinquishing all 
rights to the unit in the event that you decide to move out.  
 
What about occupancy standards? 
 
A housing provider may require that the approval of a live-in caregiver not result in 
overcrowding of the existing rental, provided that the housing provider’s occupancy 
limits are reasonable. If overcrowding will occur, it would be a reasonable 
accommodation for the landlord to allow a transfer to a larger rental.  
 
What if the live-in caregiver can’t pass a limited screening? 
 
Generally, a housing provider who conducts screening of all residents may deny 
residency to a live-in caregiver if the limited screening check reveals: 
 
• 
A record of disturbance of neighbors, destruction of property, or living or 
housekeeping habits at present or prior residences that may adversely affect the 
health, safety, or welfare of other tenants or neighbors. 
• 
Criminal activity such as crimes of physical violence to persons or property and 
other criminal acts including drug-related criminal activity that would adversely 
affect the health, safety, or welfare of other residents or staff or cause damage to 
the unit or the development. 
• 
A record of eviction from housing. 
 
However, the denial of a particular live-in caregiver should not result in denying you 
permission to select another live-in caregiver. A housing provider also may want to give 
the preferred live-in caregiver a chance to appeal the denial because there are 
situations when background checks are inaccurate, such as for someone with a 
common name. If your preferred live-in caregiver is denied, the housing provider should 
be willing to consider an alternative live-in caregiver.  
 
Are live-in caregivers to be listed on the lease as an Occupant, but not as a 
Lessee – not responsible for the terms and financial aspects of the lease?  
 
If the housing provider wishes to list a live-in caregiver on the lease, it would be as an 
occupant and not as a lessee.   
 
Remember that you are responsible for a caregiver's behavior on the premises whether 
or not the caregiver lives in the unit. If you know, or have reason to know, that the 
caregiver is engaging in wrong-doing, you have an obligation to do something about it. If 
you do nothing, the housing provider may be able to take action against you.   
 
What happens if I move out and the caregiver refuses to move?  
 
In some cases, a caregiver may wish to remain as a resident and the housing provider 
can require the live-in caregiver to submit a rental application and meet the standard 
tenancy qualifications. If, however, the caregiver refuses to move or to apply for 
tenancy, the housing provider can follow the state landlord-tenant act process for 
eviction as necessary. 
 
Where can I get help? 
 
If you apply for housing, or if you are already a resident, and a landlord or manager 
takes any of these actions towards you, you can contact a state or local civil rights 
agency to report it.  The agency will investigate your discrimination complaint for free.
