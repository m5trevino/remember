FRAUD ON THE COURT AND ABUSIVE 
DISCOVERY 
David R. Hague*∗ 
Unbeknownst to many, federal courts have the power under the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure to set aside judgments entered years earlier that were 
obtained by “fraud on the court.” Fraud on the court, however, can take many 
forms and courts and commentators agree that it is a nebulous concept. The 
power to set aside a judgment requires courts to strike a balance between the 
principles of justice and finality. A majority of courts require a showing, by clear 
and convincing evidence, of intentional fraudulent conduct specifically directed 
at the court itself. This standard is flawed. And courts that have adopted it are 
abdicating their solemn responsibility as the gatekeeper to justice because inno-
cent victims seeking to set aside judgments obtained by abusive discovery find 
themselves as a square-peg trying to fit into a round hole. The remedial and equi-
table nature of the fraud-on-the-court doctrine and the great public policy that it 
embodies militates against making that burden an impossible hurdle for victims 
of abusive discovery. 
This Article suggests that courts depart from the heightened standard used 
to set aside judgments, particularly judgments obtained by abusive discovery. 
Specifically, this Article advances a four-step process to resolve the ultimate in-
quiry: whether the abusive conduct caused the court not to perform in the usual 
manner its impartial task of adjudging cases. Under this standard, courts will 
more readily find that abusive discovery that undermines the integrity of the judi-
cial process or influences the decision of the court constitutes a fraud on the 
court.

INTRODUCTION 
There is an old adage that nice guys finish last. It is well documented that 
in litigation, this maxim oftentimes rings true. General William Tecumesh 
Sherman stated, “War is Hell!”1 Litigation, some think, is like war. Make your 
opponent’s life miserable, put them through hell, and you will eventually defeat 
your adversary. Why is hardball litigation so common? Is it because it works 
and frequently goes unpunished? As one scholar noted, “[t]hough perceptions 
differ, there seems to be some consensus that adversary excess is frequent, of-
ten not by any standard justifiable as zealous representation, and that many 
lawyers will indeed cross ethical lines when they think they can get away with 
it, which, because of the weakness of monitoring agents, they usually do.”2 
When this abusive practice—sometimes referred to by lawyers and judges 
as “Rambo-Lawyering”3—occurs during litigation, parties are equipped with 
several tools under the rules of civil procedure to thwart improper behavior and 
move the proceeding into civil territory. However, when attorney misconduct 
or abusive discovery tactics result in favorable judgments to the offending par-
ties, the available remedies under the rules diminish substantially, and the party

over, the District Court of Denver includes a “Rambo Lawyering” instruction to attorneys in 
case management orders. The instruction reads as follows: 
This is a CIVIL division. “Rambo Lawyering” will not be tolerated. Counsel will treat jurors, 
parties, witnesses, me, my staff and each other with professionalism, courtesy and respect at all 
times. This applies not only to the actual trial, but to all aspects of the case, including discovery 
and motions practice, and includes what is written as well as what is said.

FRAUD ON THE COURT 
709 
against whom the judgment was entered is now faced with a challenging legal 
hurdle. A rancher from Nevada knows this story all too well. 
In 2007, Judith Adams sued Susan Fallini for the death of her son after he 
struck one of Ms. Fallini’s cows that was on a well-known highway in Neva-
da.4 That stretch of highway is designated as “open range.”5 Nevada law pro-
tects open-range ranchers from liability if vehicles strike their cattle.6 Thus, Ms. 
Fallini should have prevailed in the lawsuit because of this statutory defense, 
but that did not happen.7 Instead, Ms. Fallini’s lawyer abandoned her during the 
case and, among other things, failed to respond to plaintiff’s requests for ad-
mission, which asked Ms. Fallini to admit that the accident did not occur on 
open range, even though it did, and even though plaintiff and her attorney knew 
it did.8 Because she failed to answer the request for admission, she was deemed 
to have admitted that the accident did not occur on open range, which obviated 
her complete defense under Nevada law.9 Eventually, Ms. Fallini’s “admission” 
led to a partial summary judgment in plaintiff’s favor and an award of damages 
in excess of $2.7 million.10 
Was the type of conduct in the Fallini case just clever lawyering and profi-
cient advocacy? Or did the attorney act uncivilly or unethically in obtaining the 
judgment and, consequently, violate rules of civil procedure and professional 
conduct? More importantly, if the attorney knew the accident occurred on open 
range and knew that the open-range defense provided a complete defense to 
Fallini as a matter of law, did that attorney perpetrate a “fraud on the court”11 
when he obtained summary judgment based on Fallini’s deemed admission of a 
well-known false fact? The answer to this last question is puzzling.  
While fraud on the court has been recognized for centuries as a basis for 
setting aside a final judgment, it has been used for several other purposes under 
the rules of civil procedure. Generally, fraud on the court is a fraud “directed to 
the judicial machinery itself and is not fraud between the parties or fraudulent 
documents . . . . It is thus fraud where . . . the impartial functions of the court 
have been directly corrupted.”12 Interestingly, the term “fraud on the court” is

only mentioned in Rule 60(d)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, yet 
courts have also used this doctrine to order dismissal or default under other 
rules where a litigant has stooped to the level of fraud on the court.13  
Generally, if a party wants to utilize the fraud-on-the-court doctrine as a 
remedy under the rules of civil procedure, it must prove, by clear and convinc-
ing evidence, intentional fraudulent conduct specifically directed at the court 
itself.14 Recent case law incorrectly suggests that this high standard for proving 
fraud on the court—which several courts agree is reserved only for the most 
egregious misconduct, such as a bribery of a judge or jury members—lacks any 
flexibility or equitable components.15 Indeed, this rigid approach seems to dis-
regard entirely the victim’s status. It also creates a nearly impossible hurdle for 
innocent victims seeking to set aside judgments obtained by attorney miscon-
duct. This flawed approach—particularly as courts apply the fraud-on-the-court 
doctrine to abusive discovery practices resulting in favorable judgments to the 
offending party—is inconsistent with the purpose of Rule 60(d)(3). 
This Article suggests that courts depart from the heightened standard used 
to set aside judgments secured by a fraud on the court. Specifically, this Article 
advances a four-step process and recommends courts focus on one specific 
question when evaluating whether conduct rises to the level of fraud on the 
court: whether the conduct complained of caused the court not to perform in the 
usual manner in its impartial task of adjudging cases.  
Part I of this Article discusses the various forms of abusive discovery that 
may lead to improper judgments, as well as some of the relevant rules of pro-
fessional conduct and civil procedure. Part I also discusses the classes of vic-
tims that are the most greatly impacted by abusive discovery. Part II introduces 
the concept of “fraud on the court” and discusses its meaning, history, and use 
in combating fraudulent litigation practice. Finally, Part III introduces the four-
step process, which requires an examination of the following: (1) the offending 
party and his duties, (2) the conduct at issue and its effect on the judicial ma-
                                                        
13  See, e.g., Combs v. Rockwell Int’l Corp., 927 F.2d 486, 488 (9th Cir. 1991) (relying on 
Rule 11 where counsel made thirty-six changes on a deposition errata sheet after the client 
advised that the transcript was accurate and the testimony was correct); Brockton Sav. Bank 
v. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., 771 F.2d 5, 11–12 (1st Cir. 1985) (affirming district 
court’s entry of default judgment under court’s inherent powers in response to defendant’s 
abusive litigation practices); Wyle v. R.J. Reynolds Indus., Inc., 709 F.2d 585, 589 (9th Cir. 
1983) (“[C]ourts have inherent power to dismiss an action when a party has willfully de-
ceived the court and engaged in conduct utterly inconsistent with the orderly administration 
of justice.”); Eppes v. Snowden, 656 F. Supp. 1267, 1279 (E.D. Ky. 1986) (finding that 
where fraud is committed upon the court, the court’s power to dismiss is inherent “to protect 
the integrity of its proceedings”).

gus subpoena, was “totally at odds with the . . . notions of fairness central to our system of 
litigation”).

chinery, (3) the victim’s status during the underlying litigation—i.e., whether 
the harmed party was in a position to recognize and combat the fraud at issue 
prejudgment—and (4) the relief sought. Part III also utilizes the four-step pro-
cess to demonstrate that advancing falsehoods during the discovery process is a 
form of fraud on the court and that courts have equitable power to entertain a 
party’s action that seeks to set aside a judgment based upon fraud during the 
discovery process.  
I.  
ABUSIVE DISCOVERY PRACTICE 
A.   Common Discovery Abuse  
In a 2008 survey conducted by the American College of Trial Lawyers 
Task Force on Discovery and the Institute for the Advancement of the Ameri-
can Legal System, 45 percent of those surveyed indicated they believed discov-
ery is abused in “almost every case.”16 And a recent law review article led with 
this statement: “[o]ur discovery system is broken.”17 Unfortunately, while the 
system may be “broken” for some, it oftentimes works for others as it allows 
them to gain a tactical advantage over their opponents.  
Abusive discovery includes, among other things, expensive and time-
consuming “inundation . . . with tons of motions, interrogatories, document re-
quests, deposition notices and other pre-trial disputes.”18 For example, in 
Adelman v. Brady, the Pennsylvania district court held that an interrogatory re-
quest in a Title VII discrimination case was “extremely burdensome” where it 
required the IRS to examine personnel files for records of reprimand with no 
limitations, such as a date range or employed staff versus unemployed staff.19 
The court found that this would “require the IRS to review thousands of 
files.”20 Accordingly, the request was determined to be unduly burdensome and 
an abuse of discovery procedures.21 
Discovery abuse also includes trickery,22 harassment,23 threats,24 and inter-
ference with depositions.25 In Prize Energy Resources, L.P. v. Cliff Hoskins,

Inc., an attorney engaged in trickery when he “secur[ed] documents under false 
pretenses” during discovery.26 The attorney used a “false letterhead” to contact 
potential witnesses regarding a case and purported to be a “businessman” for an 
oil and gas company.27 
In addition to his trickery, the same attorney also engaged in harassment to 
obtain discovery information.28 For example, he contacted the opposing party 
and “continually badgered him to produce documents that had already been 
provided,” even after the party obtained counsel.29 Additionally, he threatened 
the opposing party with “criminal penalties” if the party failed to comply.30  
Attorneys frequently adopt similar behavior to interfere with depositions 
and thwart truth telling or disclosure of facts. In re Fletcher is illustrative.31 In 
Fletcher, an attorney threatened a police-officer witness with civil liability dur-
ing his deposition as a means of intimidation by telling the officer that he had 
been added to an amended complaint alleging a Bivens action against the of-
ficer.32  
Aside from improper and unethical threats, other parties engage in Rambo-
Litigation tactics to deter depositions.33 In Van Pilsum v. Iowa State University 
of Science and Technology, the court found that an attorney’s conduct was 
sanctionable when he “monopolize[d] 20% of his client’s deposition.”34 There, 
the attorney interrupted and objected to opposing counsel’s questioning so of-
ten that between the “167 page deposition . . . only four segments [exist] where 
five or more pages occur without an interruption.”35 He also groundlessly at-
tacked opposing counsel for his “ethics, litigation experience, and honesty.”36 
For this behavior, the attorney was sanctioned and a protective order was is-
sued.37 
While the above clearly demonstrates abusive discovery tactics and mis-
conduct, the instances likely did not rise to fraud on the court. Throw in dis-
honest behavior by an officer of the court, however, and a strong argument be-
gins to unfold that a fraud on the court may be in the works. Indeed, the most

FRAUD ON THE COURT

harmful form of discovery abuse is likely in the form of attorney deceit. No one 
can dispute “the discovery system is designed to facilitate truth-finding.”38 Yet, 
deception during discovery is all too common. As one scholar noted, “one rea-
son for [attorney misconduct] is the tension inherent in the discovery pro-
cess.”39 Absent information protected by the attorney-client privilege or work-
product doctrine, the rules of civil procedure require full disclosure during dis-
covery; yet providing an opposing party with information that might harm the 
client’s case seems to conflict with zealous advocacy.40 This quandary appears 
to be a true Catch-22 from which there is no escape. Thus, when these mutually 
conflicting situations arise, “the natural tendency for many lawyers is to resist 
the disclosure of client information”41 or consciously deceive the opposing par-
ty in order to gain a tactical advantage.  
In In re Shannon,42 for example, a lawyer—the subject of the complaint 
filed by the State Bar of Arizona—materially altered some of his client’s 
handwritten answers to interrogatories without providing a copy of the altered 
interrogatories to his client.43 After the client terminated the lawyer—but while 
the lawyer was still acting as the attorney of record—he submitted the altered 
interrogatories, along with the verification to the court for support of a motion 
for summary judgment.44 Fortunately, the lawyer’s motion was denied,45 and 
the court did not have to discuss whether the lawyer committed fraud upon the 
court. The opinion arose out of disciplinary proceedings, so the focus was 
whether the attorney violated certain rules of conduct and ethics, not whether a 
fraud on the court occurred. Further, despite the altered interrogatories submit-
ted to the court, no judgment was ever obtained, and therefore, the parties were 
not seeking to set aside any judgment.46 If, however, a judgment was obtained 
in favor of the lawyer’s client based on the doctored answers to the interrogato-
ries, would this be sufficient to set aside the judgment for fraud on the court 
pursuant to Rule 60(d)(3)? The answer is unclear.  
In another similar case, In re Griffith,47 an attorney was disciplined for fail-
ing to make critical disclosures during discovery and trial concerning his cli-
ent’s medical records and treatment.48 In that case, the lawyer represented the 
estate of Morris Pina, Jr. in a lawsuit against the City of New Bedford for po-

lice misconduct.49 New Bedford police officers arrested Pina and, while in cus-
tody, he died.50 Before commencing the trial, however, the lawyer for the estate 
learned that Pina was being treated for medical problems and had tested posi-
tive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).51 And when specifically asked 
through interrogatories whether Pina had ever been treated or admitted to a 
hospital prior to the alleged incident, the estate responded that it had no 
knowledge of any treatment or admissions.52 These responses were false. The 
estate was also served with a request for documents, including a request to pro-
duce all medical records with any doctor or hospital rendering treatment on be-
half of Pina for a period of five years prior to Pina’s death.53 The lawyer never 
produced the documents he had in his possession that would have been respon-
sive to this request.54 Furthermore, the attorney retained an expert economist to 
testify on damages arising from Pina’s alleged wrongful death.55 However, the 
lawyer never told the expert about the HIV.56 Accordingly, the expert calculat-
ed the decedent’s total loss of pleasure of life exceeded two million dollars.57 
At trial, the estate was awarded damages in the amount of $435,000.58 
 But, during trial the defendant learned of the HIV and opposing counsel’s cal-
culated efforts to conceal this material information.59 Following trial, the par-
ties settled for $555,000 and defense counsel sought sanctions against the law-
yer, alleging that he had withheld this critical information during discovery and 
trial.60 After a hearing, the judge entered an order in which he found that the 
lawyer had “engaged in a pattern of activity to hide [Pina’s HIV status] from 
the defendants and initially . . . from the court, and had engaged in deliberate 
misconduct in connection with [plaintiff’s] responses to the defendants’ inter-
rogatories.”61 Again, the court was not forced to analyze Rule 60(d)(3) because 
the attorneys uncovered the deceit before a judgment was rendered. However, 
had plaintiff prevailed at trial, would the defendant have a case to set aside the 
judgment for fraud upon the court? Did the plaintiff intentionally aim the false

FRAUD ON THE COURT 
715 
In another case, In re Estrada,62 the lawyer—who was representing a 
pharmacy in a personal injury action resulting from a pharmacist accidently 
filling a child’s prescription with methadone—misled the court by falsely deny-
ing the plaintiff’s request for admission of fact.63 The lawyer’s indiscretion was 
not just a minor oversight, but rather a critical omission that could make or 
break the plaintiff’s case against the pharmacy.64 Indeed, the case resulted in a 
mistrial after it became apparent that a prescription introduced into evidence, 
intended to prove that the pharmacy could account for all its dispensed metha-
done, was a forgery.65 Fraud on the court?  
Unfortunately, the foregoing represents just a small number of cases where 
deceit and fraud are present. One would hope that the majority of attorneys un-
derstand and acknowledge that zealous representation—even aggressive repre-
sentation—can always be accomplished through playing by the rules. Indeed, 
despite the tension of litigation, lawyers are always responsible for maintaining 
the ethical standards of the profession. These standards and ethical obligations 
are governed by a combination of sources,66 which include the Federal Rules of 
Civil Procedure, state rules, and laws governing attorney conduct.67 Violating 
or otherwise ignoring these discovery-based rules have broad implications. As 
one court noted, 
A lawyer who seeks excessive discovery given what is at stake in the litigation, 
or who makes boilerplate objections to discovery requests without particulariz-
ing their basis, or who is evasive or incomplete in responding to discovery, or 
pursues discovery in order to make the cost for his or her adversary so great that 
the case settles to avoid the transaction costs, or who delays the completion of 
discovery to prolong the litigation in order to achieve a tactical advantage, or 
who engages in any of the myriad forms of discovery abuse that are so com-
monplace is . . . hindering the adjudication process, and . . . violating his or her 
duty of loyalty to the “procedures and institutions” the adversary system is in-
tended to serve.68 
Notwithstanding the procedural and ethical components of these rules, 
there will always be lawyers and parties that simply disregard or sidestep the 
rules to gain an advantage. And it does not matter whether the rule falls within 
a “gray area” of law or is replete with obvious warnings and penalties designed 
to deter the offending party from abusive practice. 
Consider, for example, Rule 26(g) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
This rule—“[o]ne of the most important, but apparently least understood or fol-

lowed, of the discovery rules”69—clearly and expressly requires that “every 
discovery request, response, or objection be signed by at least one attorney of 
record, . . . or by the [client], if unrepresented.”70 The signature “certifies that to 
the best of the person’s knowledge, information, and belief formed after a rea-
sonable inquiry,” the discovery is complete and correct, and that the discovery 
request, response, or objection is  
(i) consistent with these rules and warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous 
argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law, or for establishing 
new law; (ii) not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause 
unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation; and (iii) neither 
unreasonable nor unduly burdensome or expensive, considering the needs of the 
case, prior discovery in the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance 
of the issues at stake in the action.71  
If a lawyer or party makes the certification required by Rule 26(g) that violates 
the rule, the court “must” impose an appropriate sanction, which may include 
an order to pay reasonable expenses and attorney’s fees caused by the viola-
tion.72 But do fraudulent responses to written discovery, for example, expose a 
party to default or dismissal for committing fraud on the court?  
 Rule 26 is clear on its face and in its purpose: deter abusive discovery and 
sanction offending parties for misconduct in discovery. One would think that 
the transparencies of the rule and the obvious consequences for compliance 
would have a strong deterrent effect, yet that is not always the case. In addition 
to Rule 26, other remedies exist to prevent abusive discovery, including sanc-

71  Id. 
72  Id. The Advisory Committee’s Notes to Rule 26(g) provide further guidance:  
Rule 26(g) imposes an affirmative duty to engage in pretrial discovery in a responsible manner 
that is consistent with the spirit and purposes of Rules 26 through 37. In addition, Rule 26(g) is 
designed to curb discovery abuse by explicitly encouraging the imposition of sanctions. The 
subdivision provides a deterrent to both excessive discovery and evasion by imposing a certifica-
tion requirement that obliges each attorney to stop and think about the legitimacy of a discovery 
request, a response thereto, or an objection. . . . 
If primary responsibility for conducting discovery is to continue to rest with the litigants, they 
must be obliged to act responsibly and avoid abuse. With this in mind, Rule 26(g), which paral-
lels the amendments to Rule 11, requires an attorney or unrepresented party to sign each discov-
ery request, response, or objection. . . .  
Although the certification duty requires the lawyer to pause and consider the reasonableness of 
his request, response, or objection, it is not meant to discourage or restrict necessary and legiti-
mate discovery. The rule simply requires that the attorney make a reasonable inquiry into the 
factual basis of his response, request, or objection. 
The duty to make a “reasonable inquiry” is satisfied if the investigation undertaken by the at-
torney and the conclusions drawn therefrom are reasonable under the circumstances. It is an ob-
jective standard similar to the one imposed by Rule 11.

tions,73 discovery statutes,74 and misconduct-reporting boards.75 These rules 
and remedies share a few common shortfalls. First, they are written and used to 
deter abusive conduct during the litigation. However, these rules have little 
utility post-judgment (i.e., if abusive discovery leads to an improper judgment, 
these rules have minimal value or impact). Second, while these rules may com-
bat abuse that otherwise might lead to improper judgments, the rules are plainly 
more effective in the hands of competent attorneys who understand how they 
operate and how they can potentially deter attorney misconduct. Yet, when vic-
tims of abusive discovery are representing themselves pro se, or have been 
abandoned by counsel, the rules serve a very limited function, if any, in these 
victims’ hands.  
B.   The Vulnerable Victims  
Abusive discovery practice comes in all shapes and sizes. From the multi-
billion-dollar case with hundreds of defendants to the ten-thousand dollar 
breach of contract case, one is likely to find attorneys engaging in unsound liti-
gation tactics. Any party on the receiving end of this abuse is a victim and has 
standing to seek redress from the court. However, abusive discovery’s impact 
seems to be far greater for two classes of victims: the pro se litigant and the at-
torney-abandoned litigant. Should these victims receive special treatment when 
faced with judgments obtained by fraud? Is their status relevant to the court’s 
analysis under Rule 60(d)(3)—i.e., should the courts be more flexible and will-
ing to set aside judgments in cases where the victim was not adequately repre-
sented by counsel when the fraud occurred?  
1.   The Pro Se Litigant  
The saying goes, “one who is his own lawyer has a fool for a client.”76 In 
Powell v. Alabama,77 the Supreme Court wrote, 
Even the intelligent and educated layman has small and sometimes no skill in 
the science of law. . . . He lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to pre-
pare his defense, even though he have a perfect one. He requires the guiding 
                                                        
73  See, e.g., In re Lucas, 789 N.W.2d 73, 78 (N.D. 2010) (suspending an attorney for mis-
conduct). Sanctions can also include paying opposing party’s attorney’s fees. 
74  See, e.g., FED. R. CIV. P. 26(b)(2)(C) (providing that a court “must limit the frequency or 
extent of discovery”); FED. R. CIV. P. 33(a)(1) (providing that “[u]nless otherwise stipulated 
or ordered by the court, a party may serve on any other party no more than 25 written inter-
rogatories”); FED. R. CIV. P. 37(a)(1) (allowing a party to compel discovery); FED. R. CIV. P. 
45(d)(3)(A) (authorizing a district court to quash a subpoena if it subjects a person, including 
a non-party, to an undue burden, fails to allow for a reasonable time for compliance, or re-
quires disclosure of confidential information).

hand of counsel at every step in the proceeding against him. Without it, though 
he be not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does not know 
how to establish his innocence. If that be true of men of intelligence, how much 
more true is it of the ignorant and illiterate, or those of feeble intellect.78 
So why would anyone choose to appear pro se? The likely response is that 
they have no choice. They are victims of a legal market failure. On the demand 
side, most Americans struggle to find a lawyer to provide them with legal ad-
vice. On the supply side, law school graduates and other lawyers are either un-
employed or underemployed.79 Chief Justice Warren Burger predicted thirty-
five years ago that America was turning into “a society overrun by hordes of 
lawyers, hungry as locusts.”80 But what are these lawyers craving? Pro bono 
work? Serving the underprivileged? Not likely. Lawyers, generally, provide for 
the legal needs of those individuals and businesses that can deliver a secure re-
tainer and pay a considerable amount of money. However, there are only so 
many low-risk, high-paying clients around. As a result, scores of the American 
population are forced to represent themselves because lawyers are either not 
willing to take on the risk of not being paid or not willing to devote a signifi-
cant amount of time to serving the underprivileged.  
This “pro se” problem was recently highlighted in states where foreclo-
sures require a judge’s approval. “[H]omeowners in default have traditionally 
surrendered their homes without ever coming to court to defend themselves.”81 
That inaction, however, has begun to recede.82 Indeed, “[w]hile many foreclo-
sures are still unopposed, courts are seeing a sharp rise in cases where defend-
ants show up representing themselves.”83 Some courts “welcome[] the influx of 
parties defending themselves.”84 Louis McDonald, the chief judge for New 
Mexico’s Thirteenth Judicial District, acknowledged that “[s]ome of [the pro se 
defendants] have fairly legitimate defenses.”85 But the law grows more com-
plex as cases progress through litigation, and several of the pro se defendants 
are in over their heads and unable to combat abusive practice.86 These parties 
are susceptible to the problems highlighted above. “Admit you signed the loan 
documents.” “Admit you are in default.” “Admit we hold the deed of trust 
against your home and we are the entitled beneficiaries.” If true, these requests 
to admit, alone, could establish a lender’s prima facie foreclosure case. But 
what if the plaintiff submitting these requests was not the beneficiary? What if 
they were not in possession of the promissory note and the deed of trust? That

alone would be sufficient to prevent the lender from foreclosing. If the requests 
went unanswered, they would be deemed admitted.87 By asking the homeown-
ers to admit known falsehoods and then injecting those falsehoods into the 
court system to support a motion for summary judgment, would the plaintiff 
seeking to foreclose be committing fraud on the court?  
New York has experienced similar issues. Before 2008, “about 90 percent 
of foreclosure defendants never appeared before a judge.”88 However, with new 
mandatory settlement laws in place, “more than three-quarters of defendants 
now show up to court, about 32,000 in the first [ten months of 2010].”89 How-
ever, only about 12,000 had a lawyer.90 The other 20,000 were in charge of 
their own fate. “We’re getting the people in here, getting them to the table with 
the bank, but I don’t know what happens to these cases long term,” said Paul 
Lewis, chief of staff to New York’s chief administrative judge.91 “Many of the 
homeowners would do much better with an attorney.”92 
Unlike criminal proceedings, the right to counsel is not absolute in civil 
cases.93 This further strengthens the argument that most pro se appearances by 
civil litigants are not voluntary, but instead result because they simply cannot 
afford attorneys to represent them. This is especially true when one considers 
the potential costs involved with discovery alone. Indeed, “[p]erhaps the great-
est driving force in litigation today is discovery. Discovery abuse is a principal 
cause of high litigation transaction costs.”94 Unfortunately, “in far too many 
cases, economics—and not the merits—govern discovery decisions.”95 The re-
sult is that “[l]itigants of moderate means are often deterred through discovery 
from vindicating claims or defenses, and the litigation process all too often be-
comes a war of attrition for all parties.”96 
If the right to counsel were absolute in civil cases, pro se appearances 
would decrease significantly, if not entirely. For several justifiable reasons, 
however, this is not how the American legal system functions. Because of this, 
some courts accord pro se litigants a certain degree of leniency, particularly 
                                                        
87  See, e.g., FED. R. CIV. P. 36(a)(3) (stating that “[a] matter is admitted unless, within 30 
days after being served, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting 
party a written answer or objection addressed to the matter and signed by the party or its at-
torney”).

[Vol. 16:707  
with respect to procedural rules.97 Notwithstanding, extending too much leni-
ency undermines the system. As one court recently explained,  
[T]he Court may not be co-opted by a pro se litigant to perform tasks normally 
carried out by hired counsel. Providing assistance or extending too much proce-
dural leniency to a pro se litigant risks undermining the impartial role of the 
judge in the adversary system. Moreover, it has never been suggested that pro-
cedural rules in ordinary civil litigation should be interpreted so as to excuse 
mistakes by those who proceed without counsel. Pro se litigants must adhere to 
procedural rules as would parties assisted by counsel. This includes procedural 
requirements regarding the provision of adequate factual averments to sustain 
legal claims.98 
In other words, claims of discovery abuse may be null, even if there is 
some trickery or omission from the opposing counsel because procedural rules 
tend to apply uniformly to pro se and represented parties, regardless of the une-
qual knowledge of the law.99 For example, in Tall v. Alaska Airlines, a Ken-
tucky court of appeals held that a pro se defendant’s belief that he had entered a 
settlement agreement with the plaintiff’s counsel during discovery did not pro-
vide a remedy when he failed to submit a denial in a request for admissions.100 
The defendant defaulted on a credit agreement and responded to a complaint 
filed by the bank by “denying that he owed any debt.”101 He stated that he dis-
cussed a settlement amount with the bank’s attorney that would allow him to 
bring his account current; this conversation allegedly occurred prior to suit.102 
A review of the case indicates there was a misunderstanding as to the agree-
ment, and instead of a monthly payment, the defendant rendered the total “prin-
cipal amount,” minus “interest owed, costs, or fees.”103  
During discovery, the opposing counsel requested admissions and the de-
fendant failed to answer, resulting in his admission that he still owed the 
debt.104 The defendant argued that counsel had “tak[en] advantage of [his] ig-
norance of the law” in violation of a state statute that required parties to make a 
“good faith effort” to resolve discovery disputes.105 Yet, the court held that be-
cause the “unanswered admission requests are deemed admitted . . . there is no

foreseeable reason for a party to seek to compel such admissions.”106 There-
fore, an opposing attorney does not have a duty to warn another party, even pro 
se, to follow discovery procedures.107  
This Article does not necessarily advocate for extra-judicial assistance to 
pro se litigants.108 Instead, it highlights a growing problem: pro se litigants are 
becoming more plentiful and they lack legal skill and knowledge to oppose ag-
gressive counsel. As one scholar noted,  
Our civil process before and during trial, in state and federal courts, is a master-
piece of complexity that dazzles in its details—in discovery, in the use of ex-
perts, in the preparation and presentation of evidence, in the selection of the fact-
finder and the choreography of the trial. But few litigants or courts can afford 
it.109 
When a party opponent senses this weakness, it will seize its prey. In one 
article discussing foreclosures and pro se parties, it was noted that lawyers 
“pretty much bank on people not showing up, or not having an attorney to rep-
resent them.”110 Consequently, in addition to facing the aggressive lawyer, the 
misguided and naïve litigant is likely to encounter an opposing party who re-
fuses to play by the rules because it knows (1) the chances of being caught, 
sanctioned, or challenged are relatively small and (2) the probability of prevail-
ing in the lawsuit is significantly greater if the rules are not observed. The 
skilled lawyer, knowing that his opponent is not qualified, is thus encouraged to 
engage in improper or unsound litigation tactics.111 During the pending litiga-
tion, there are several remedies available to thwart abusive litigation practice. 
Yet, when abusive practice actually leads to a judgment in favor of the perpe-

108  Some courts actually do accord “special attention” to pro se litigants faced with proce-
dural complexities, such as summary judgment motions. Ham v. Smith, 653 F.2d 628, 629–
30 (D.C. Cir. 1981). Indeed, some courts agree that a litigant is entitled to be warned that 
when she is confronted by a summary judgment motion, she must obtain evidentiary material 
to avoid the entry of judgment against her. See, e.g., Timms v. Frank, 953 F.2d 281, 285 (7th

trator, the pro se litigant is left with very few procedural arrows in his quiver to 
combat the wrongdoing. 
2.   The Attorney-Abandoned Litigant  
Pro se litigants are not the only victims abused by improper gamesmanship. 
The Fallini case introduced in the Introduction represents the classic example 
of attorney abandonment.  
When Fallini was sued, she retained an attorney to represent and defend 
her.112 He filed an answer on Fallini’s behalf. At the time of the lawsuit, Fallini 
was over sixty years of age and had no legal skills or knowledge of the proce-
dures involved in a lawsuit.113 She relied on and trusted her attorney to resolve 
the legal dispute quickly, efficiently and competently. In June 2007, shortly af-
ter her attorney filed Fallini’s answer, he represented to her that the case was 
over and that she had prevailed because of her statutory open-range defense.114 
Unbeknownst to Fallini, however, the case was not over. In fact, litigation con-
tinued by way of discovery requests and motion practice by counsel for the 
plaintiff, but Fallini’s attorney failed to answer various requests for admission, 
oppose a motion for summary judgment based on those unanswered requests 
for admissions, appear for a hearing on the motion for summary judgment, or 
respond to other discovery requests.115  
Fallini “did not receive direct notice of the foregoing neglect of her attor-
ney.”116 Nonetheless, the court entered partial summary judgment in which it 
imposed liability on Fallini for the accident.117 In particular, Fallini was deemed 
to have admitted that the accident did not occur on open range—which obviat-
ed her complete defense to the action pursuant to NRS § 568.360(1)—even 
though she had already asserted that defense in her answer.118 
The court later held her attorney in contempt of court and repeatedly im-
posed significant sanctions for his failure to appear and comply with its orders 
in the case.119 “But despite these court-imposed sanctions, Fallini was still not

and that she had prevailed—that Fallini learned the true status of her case—that 
a judgment exceeding $2.7 million had been entered against her despite her 
ironclad statutory defense.121  
In situations where attorney misconduct like that discussed above leads to a 
favorable judgment, Rule 60(d)(3) should serve as a wide-open door that vic-
tims can enter unhindered. One of the major problems associated with attorney 
abandonment is the difficultly in reversing the wrongdoing, especially if the 
party is faced with an adverse judgment. Abandonment has been defined in 
very strict terms and requires a high bar before a party may gain relief from 
judgment due to its own counsel’s inadequacy.122 Though not a discovery-
abuse case, in Maples v. Thomas,123 the United States Supreme Court recently 
held that a “habeas prisoner’s default” would be excused when the filing dead-
line was missed due to his attorneys’ abandonment because “a client cannot be 
charged with the acts or omissions of an attorney who has abandoned him.”124 
However, this is a high bar, requiring “extraordinary circumstances beyond . . . 
[a party’s] control,” such as “evidence [of] counsel’s near-total failure to com-
municate with, [or respond to], petitioner.”125 A procedural error, such as miss-
ing a filing deadline, does not fit the mold.126 Abandonment requires something 
more akin to the injured party in Maple where the attorneys not only failed to 
file the petition, but also, among other things, (1) took on new employment, (2) 
failed to notify their client, (3) failed to withdraw, (4) allowed ineffective coun-
sel to take over, and (5) permitted clerical issues to occur at their firm that de-
prived the client of important communications.127 Furthermore, the “attorney 
abandonment” addressed by the Supreme Court occurred in a criminal proce-
dure context, not in a civil suit.128 
Accordingly, without facts similar to this extreme example of abandonment 
in a criminal case, courts are left to their discretion to render judgment against 
a party due to his own attorney’s misconduct during discovery. Though failing 
to communicate with a client129 and failing to file orders or respond to re-

quests130 are common, these actions generally do not afford relief, even when it 
is the fault of the represented party’s counsel. 
For example, in Platinum Rehab, Ltd. v. Platinum Home Health Care Ser-
vices, an Ohio district court found that abandonment arising to “extraordinary 
circumstances” did not exist when the represented party could not show she 
was free from fault after her attorney failed to meet several deadlines, resulting 
in judgment against her.131 The defendant alleged that her attorney was “grossly 
negligent” and “abandoned representation” when he failed to answer a com-
plaint, respond to discovery requests, and failed to appear at a hearing.132 Yet, 
the court found that she was not abandoned for three reasons.133 First, she was 
present and aware of the filing dates for the answer and discovery requests.134 
Second, there was no evidence except her own statement that she provided the 
necessary information for the discovery requests.135 Third, there was no evi-
dence that she made an effort “to ensure” her attorney complied with the dead-
lines.136 For these reasons, the court upheld the judgment against the defendant, 
even though her own counsel was negligent.137 But what if the complaint or 
discovery requests that went unanswered were peppered with inaccurate, mis-
leading, or fraudulent statements that allowed the plaintiff to obtain a judgment 
against the attorney-abandoned defendant? What would be the defendant’s 
remedy? How could that judgment be set aside? Even if she was not free from 
fault because she was aware of the filing dates, would that somehow offset any 
fraud that occurred during discovery or mitigate the harm? 
In another case, a Michigan court of appeals held that “effective abandon-
ment” was not a legal term and denied reversing judgment against the plaintiff 
that resulted from the plaintiff’s attorney’s failure to comply with discovery.138

FRAUD ON THE COURT 
725 
In Beck v. Cass County Road Commission, the trial court dismissed the plain-
tiff’s complaint as a “sanction for the willful failure to comply with an order to 
compel discovery.”139 In denying the plaintiff’s motion for relief from judg-
ment, the court determined that relief was unwarranted because an attorney’s 
professional negligence is attributable to the client and does not ordinarily con-
stitute grounds for setting aside judgments.140 Even though the plaintiffs 
claimed that they were effectively abandoned by this non-assistance, the court 
found that there was no legal basis for this claim.141 Thus, the attorney’s lack of 
vigor and lack of compliance was insufficient to allow relief from judgment.142 
As illustrated in the Fallini case, a false admission, which stems from an 
attorney failing to respond adequately to a request for admission, may lead to a 
dangerous result: an improper judgment unsupported by any law.143 While a 
court may have no problem withdrawing a false admission in a discovery doc-
ument while discovery is ongoing,144 there is little guidance to show how a 
court would consider a false admission after judgment has been entered.145 A 
party who is represented and is subjected to judgment due to his own party’s 
misconduct has very limited remedies. For states that impute liability, Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 60146—or state-law equivalents—appear to be 
the only source of relief.147 
II.   FRAUD ON THE COURT 
Rule 60(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides the 
grounds for relief from a final judgment, order, or proceeding, states that the 
rule “does not limit a court’s power to . . . set aside a judgment for fraud on the 
court.”148  
What is “fraud on the court” within the meaning of Rule 60? Are there cer-
tain time limitations associated with this rule for parties seeking grounds for

[Vol. 16:707  
relief from a final judgment? Does “fraud on the court” require the same stand-
ard of proof for common law fraud? Was that intent of the rule’s framers?  
Rule 60(d)(3) was added in 1948.149 The framers’ intention may best be in-
dicated in the Advisory’s Committee’s discussion of the rule: 
The amendment . . . mak[es] fraud an express ground for relief by motion; and 
under the saving clause, fraud may be urged as a ground for relief by independ-
ent action insofar as established doctrine permits. And the rule expressly does 
not limit the power of the court . . . to give relief under the savings clause. As an 
illustration of the situation, see Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford Empire Co. 
[322 U.S. 238 (1944)].150  
Because of the express reference to Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-
Empire Co.,151 an examination of this case is important for a full understanding 
of the meaning of the phrase. Hartford, in support of an application for a patent, 
submitted to the Patent Office an article—drafted by an attorney of Hartford—
referring to the contested process as a “revolutionary device.” The company 
had arranged to have the article printed in a trade journal under the name of an 
ostensibly disinterested person.152 The Patent Office relied heavily on this arti-
cle in granting the patent application.153 Hartford then sued Hazel, charging in-
fringement of the patent. The Third Circuit, in upholding the validity of the pa-
tent, also relied on the article.154 Eventually, Hazel yielded and paid Hartford 
$1,000,000 and entered into a licensing agreement.155 Approximately ten years 
later, the information about the fraud surrounding the agreement was brought to 
light.156 Hazel then filed an action with the court to have the judgment against it 
set aside and the judgment of the district court reinstated.157 The Supreme 
Court, in an opinion authored by Justice Black, held that the judgment must be 
vacated:158  
[T]he general rule [is] that [federal courts will] not alter or set aside their judg-
ments after the expiration of the term at which the judgments were finally en-
tered. . . . [but] 
 . . . . 
[e]very element of the fraud here disclosed demands the exercise of the his-
toric power of equity to set aside fraudulently begotten judgments. This is not 
simply a case of a judgment obtained with the aid of a witness who, on the basis 
of after-discovered evidence, is believed possibly to have been guilty of perjury.

FRAUD ON THE COURT 
727 
Here, even if we consider nothing but Hartford’s sworn admissions, we find a 
deliberately planned and carefully executed scheme to defraud not only the Pa-
tent Office but the Circuit Court of Appeals.159 
Additionally, although Hazel may not have exercised proper diligence in 
uncovering the fraud, the Court thought it immaterial.160 Indeed, it noted the 
case did not concern just the private parties, but rather the public at large be-
cause there are “issues of great moment to the public in a patent suit.”161 It then 
stated,  
Furthermore, tampering with the administration of justice in the manner indis-
putably shown here involves far more than an injury to a single litigant. It is a 
wrong against the institutions set up to protect and safeguard the public, institu-
tions in which fraud cannot complacently be tolerated consistently with the good 
order of society. Surely it cannot be that preservation of the integrity of the judi-
cial process must always wait upon the diligence of litigants. The public welfare 
demands that the agencies of public justice be not so impotent that they must 
always be mute and helpless victims of deception and fraud.162  
Interestingly, the Court held that it need not decide to what extent the pub-
lished article by Hartford had influenced the judges who voted to uphold the 
patent or whether the article was the primary basis of that ruling because “Hart-
ford’s officials and lawyers thought the article material” and they were in “no 
position now to dispute its effectiveness.”163 And since the fraud had been di-
rected to the Third Circuit, that court was the appropriate court to remedy the 
fraud.164 Thus, the Supreme Court directed the Third Circuit to vacate its 1932 
judgment and to direct the district court to deny all relief to Hartford.165 
Nearly all of the principles that govern a claim of fraud on the court come 
from the Hazel-Atlas case.166 First, the power to set aside a judgment exists in 
every court.167 Second, in whichever court the fraud was committed, that court 
should consider the matter.168 Third, while parties have the right to file a mo-
tion requesting the court to set aside a judgment procured by fraud, the court 
may also proceed on its own motion.169 Indeed, one court stated that the facts 
that had come to its attention “not only justify the inquiry but impose upon us 
the duty to make it, even if no party to the original cause should be willing to 
cooperate, to the end that the records of the court might be purged of fraud, if

[Vol. 16:707  
any should be found to exist.”170 Fourth, unlike just about every other remedy 
or claim existing under the rules of civil procedure or common law, there is no 
time limit on setting aside a judgment obtained by fraud, nor can laches bar 
consideration of the matter.171 The logic is clear: “[T]he law favors discovery 
and correction of corruption of the judicial process even more than it requires 
an end to lawsuits.”172  
The United States Supreme Court—in a case a few years after the Hazel-
Atlas case—discussed some of the appropriate procedures used in adjudicating 
fraud on the court claims.  
The power to unearth such a fraud is the power to unearth it effectively. Accord-
ingly, a federal court may bring before it by appropriate means all those who 
may be affected by the outcome of its investigation. But if the rights of parties 
are to be adjudicated in such an investigation, the usual safeguards of adversary 
proceedings must be observed.173 
Since Hazel-Atlas, a considerable number of courts have had the oppor-
tunity to dissect the meaning of “fraud on the court” and several definitions 
have been attempted. A number of courts have held that a “fraud on the court” 
occurs “where it can be demonstrated, clearly and convincingly, that a party has 
sentiently set in motion some unconscionable scheme calculated to interfere 
with the judicial system’s ability impartially to adjudicate a matter by improp-
erly influencing the trier or unfairly hampering the presentation of the opposing 
party’s claim or defense.”174 
Fraud on the court is a very high bar. The Tenth Circuit has held that it is 
fraud “directed to the judicial machinery itself and is not fraud between the par-
ties or fraudulent documents . . . . It is thus fraud where . . . the impartial func-
tions of the court have been directly corrupted.”175 And “only the most egre-
gious misconduct, such as bribery of a judge or members of a jury, or the 
fabrication of evidence by a party in which an attorney is implicated, will con-
stitute a fraud on the court.”176 
Some courts require the moving party to meet certain elements in order to 
set aside a judgment for fraud on the court. For example, in the Third Circuit,

FRAUD ON THE COURT 
729 
fraud on the court applies to only “the most egregious misconduct directed to 
the court itself”177 and requires the following elements: “(1) an intentional 
fraud; (2) by an officer of the court; (3) which is directed at the court itself; and 
(4) in fact deceives the court.”178 
Furthermore, fraud on the court under Rule 60(d)(3) does not encompass 
“ordinary fraud,” and must also be distinguished from “fraud” under Rule 
60(b)(3)—i.e., those frauds which are not directed to the judicial machinery it-
self.179 Rule 60(b)(3) provides relief from judgment where there is “fraud . . . 
misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party.”180 “Fraud upon the 
court as distinguished from fraud on an adverse party is limited to fraud which 
seriously affects the integrity of the normal process of adjudication.”181 Ac-
cordingly, the standard for establishing fraud on the court under Rule 60(d)(3) 
“is higher and distinct from the more general standard for fraud under Rule 
60(b)(3).”182 Furthermore, while Rule 60(c)(1) limits to one year the time with-
in which a motion under Rule 60(b)(3) must be made, a claim based upon fraud 
on the court under Rule 60(d)(3) is intended “to protect the integrity of the ju-
dicial process” and, therefore, is not time barred.183 
Despite the definitions and standards developed by the courts, the distinc-
tion between “fraud” and “fraud on the court” is unclear and much confusion 
still exists about what type of conduct falls into this category. As one court que-
ried, 
What is meant by “defile the court itself”? What is meant by “fraud perpetrated 
by officers of the court”? Does this include attorneys? Does it include the case in 
which an attorney is deceived by his client, and is thus led to deceive the court? 
The most that we can get . . . is that the phrase “fraud on the court” should be 
read narrowly, in the interest of preserving the finality of judgments, which is an 
important legal and social interest. We agree, but do not find this of much help 
to us in deciding the question before us.184 
As one commentator noted, “[p]erhaps the principal contribution of all of 
these attempts to define ‘fraud upon the court’ and to distinguish it from mere 
‘fraud’ is [] a reminder that there is a distinction.”185 If any fraud connected 
with the presentation of a case to a court is fraud on the court, then Rule 
60(b)(3) and the time restraints imposed on that rule lose meaning. Nonethe-
less, because of its opaque meaning and application, several arguments can be 
made that abusive discovery between the parties, which ultimately results in a

When, if ever, will abusive discovery practices rise to the level of fraud on 
the court within the meaning of Rule 60(d)(3)? Do the current standards adopt-
ed by the courts preclude utilizing Rule 60(d)(3) to set aside judgments pro-
cured by deceptive or misleading discovery? Is it proper to modify the height-
ened standard under Rule 60(d)(3) based on the victim, the offender, and the 
relief sought?  
Unfortunately, courts tend to focus on antiquated standards when analyzing 
whether a party has committed fraud on the court, but fail to recognize the flex-
ibility and equitable nature of the fraud-on-the-court rule. Indeed, nearly all 
courts that undertake the fraud-on-the-court analysis begin their opinions with 
the Hazel-Atlas case, then discuss the standards and definitions adopted by oth-
er courts, and finally decide whether the facts fit within that definition and 
standard.186 The problem with this flawed analysis, however, is that victims of 
fraudulent discovery find themselves as a square-peg trying to fit into a round 
hole. But each case is unique and must be assessed and adjudicated according 
to its own facts.  
Accordingly, this article suggests that courts engage in a four-step process 
that requires (1) examination of the offender and his duties to the court, (2) 
evaluation of the conduct and its effect, (3) consideration of the victim’s status 
(the equitable component), and (4) consideration of the relief being sought. By 
engaging in this four-step process, courts may be more willing to set aside 
judgments under Rule 60(d)(3) when abusive discovery occurs that influences 
the decisions of courts. 
A.   The Offender and His Duty 
When abusive discovery is at issue, the offending party will likely be an at-
torney.187 Why is the offender’s status important to the analysis? “An attorney 
is an officer of the court and owes the court fiduciary duties and loyalty.”188 
Accordingly, “[w]hen an attorney misrepresents or omits material facts to the 
court, or acts on a client’s perjury or distortion of evidence, his conduct may 
                                                        
186  See, e.g., Murray v. Ledbetter, 144 P.3d 492, 498 (Alaska 2006) (discussing Hazel-
Atlas’s “strict” definition of the elements necessary to prove fraud on the court, the tracing of 
the rule, and whether, “[i]n keeping with Hazel-Atlas,” the activity at hand constituted a 
fraud on the court). 
187  Obviously, there may be some situations where pro-se litigants are the one conducting 
abusive discovery, but that appears to be a rare occurrence.

constitute a fraud on the court.”189 Furthermore, when an officer of the court 
fails to correct a misrepresentation or retract false evidence submitted to the 
court, it may also constitute fraud on the court.190 Notwithstanding, examina-
tion of the offender and his duty is not limited solely to an attorney’s duty of 
candor toward the tribunal.191 Rather, the analysis requires courts to examine 
certain duties that arise well before the offender involves the court. 
At the outset, Rule 26(g) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires 
that an attorney of record sign discovery-related filings, and prescribes that the 
signature certifies that “to the best of the person’s knowledge, information, and 
belief formed after a reasonable inquiry” the discovery request, response, or ob-
jection is “consistent with these rules and warranted by existing law.”192 The 
signature also certifies that the request, response, or objection is “not interposed 
for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or need-
lessly increase the cost of litigation.”193 Accordingly, Rule 26 obligates “each 
attorney to stop and think about the legitimacy of a discovery request, a re-
sponse thereto, or an objection”194 and to make a reasonable inquiry into the 
factual and legal basis of his response, request, or objection. The Model Rules 
of Professional Conduct provide further guidance.  
Lawyers are professionally and ethically responsible for accuracy in their 
representations to the court. Rule 3.1 of the Model Rules of Professional Con-
duct states that lawyers “shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or 
controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so 
that is not frivolous, which includes a good-faith argument for an extension, 
modification or reversal of existing law.”195 Similarly, Rule 3.3 provides that 
“[a] lawyer shall not knowingly . . . make a false statement of fact or law to a 
tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously 
made to the tribunal by the lawyer.”196 
In addition to the rules of professional conduct and an attorney’s duty of 
candor as an officer of the court, “Rule 11 [of the F.R.C.P.] imposes a duty on 
attorneys to certify that they have conducted a reasonable inquiry and have de-
termined that any papers filed with the court are well grounded in fact, legally 
tenable, and not interposed for any improper purpose.”197 The United States 
Supreme Court has held that Rule 11,

[Vol. 16:707  
imposes on any party who signs a pleading, motion, or other paper—whether the 
party’s signature is required by the Rule or is provided voluntarily—an affirma-
tive duty to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the facts and the law before filing, 
and that the applicable standard is one of reasonableness under the circumstanc-
es.198 
An examination of the offender and his duties is important because, as dis-
cussed below, violations of Rule 26, Rule 11, or even the rules of professional 
conduct may give rise to a fraud-on-the-court claim, even if those violations 
were not specifically directed to the court itself. 
B.   Evaluation of the Conduct 
After evaluating the offender and his duties, courts should analyze the con-
duct at issue. In examining the conduct, however, this Article suggests that the 
heightened standard adopted by several courts for fraud on the court does not 
comport with the rationale for employing Rule 60(d)(3) to set aside judgments. 
Instead, this Article suggests that courts examine one specific question when 
evaluating the conduct: did the conduct cause the court not to perform in the 
usual manner in its impartial task of adjudging cases?  
While some suggest that the fraud or deceit committed by the attorney 
must be aimed directly at the court to constitute fraud on the court, this position 
seems faulty; however, it raises an important issue: since “[f]raud between the 
parties and fraud on the court are two distinct bases for post-judgment re-
lief,”199 how can a victim use Rule 60(d)(3) to ever set aside a judgment? In 
other words, abusive discovery is aimed at the opposing party rather than the 
court, and, thus, it would appear a victim has no claim under Rule 60(d)(3). But 
that is not necessarily true. Fraud on the court can originate from abusive dis-
covery and find its way, sometimes unintentionally, to the steps of the court-
house. Accordingly, it is a myopic approach to only examine the arrow that the 
attorney shot towards the court and then decide whether the arrow was suffi-
ciently harmful to constitute fraud on the court. Rather, a proper approach will 
examine all of the arrows the attorney shot at the victim and then analyze which 
arrows found their way to the court and the impact those arrows caused on the 
judgment.  
Thus, for example, if an adversary misrepresents certain relevant infor-
mation, fails to disclose such information, requests admissions that he knows to 
be false, lies during a deposition, or engages in any other deceitful form of dis-
covery, he has clearly violated Rule 26 and has potentially engaged in fraud, 
misrepresentation, or other misconduct prohibited by ethical rules and state and 
federal rules of civil procedure. Admittedly, fraud on the court requires more 
than misconduct between the adverse parties—it must be some sort of miscon-
duct that hampers the judicial machinery. Therefore, the critical component to

FRAUD ON THE COURT

the analysis is whether the offending party utilizes the information it obtained 
through abusive discovery practices to obtain a favorable judgment. 
In Kupferman v. Consolidated Research & Manufacturing Corp,200 the 
court stated that 
[w]hile an attorney “should represent his client with singular loyalty that loyalty 
obviously does not demand that he act dishonestly or fraudulently; on the con-
trary his loyalty to the court, as an officer thereof, demands integrity and honest 
dealing with the court.” And when he departs from that standard in the conduct 
of a case he perpetrates a fraud upon the court.201 
In other words, “[s]ince attorneys are officers of the court, their conduct, if dis-
honest, would constitute fraud on the court.”202 
In order to establish fraud on the court, some courts require the movant to 
prove by clear and convincing evidence intentional fraudulent conduct specifi-
cally directed at the court itself.203 For example, the Tenth Circuit had held that 
the fraud must directed to the judicial machinery itself and cannot be fraud or 
misconduct between the parties or fraudulent documents exchanged between 
the parties.204 Other courts have held that an action for fraud on the court is 
available only when the movant can show an “unconscionable plan or scheme” 
to improperly influence the court’s decision.205 Under this strict approach, one 
could argue that the only cases of fraud on the court would be those of bribery 
of a judge or members of a jury. In fact, the strict approach would arguably 
take away any consideration of the conduct that occurred between the parties or 
an attorney making filings to the court without making “an inquiry reasonable 
under the circumstances,” as required under Rule 11(b).206  
This strict approach in evaluating the conduct that occurred, however, 
seems inconsistent with the purpose of Rule 60(d)(3). If the judicial machinery 
is unable to perform in the usual manner in its impartial task of adjudicating 
cases because of attorney misconduct, why does fraud on the court require the 
conduct at issue to be intentional and aimed directly at the court itself? Why 
does it have to be an intentional “plan” or “scheme”?207 On the contrary, if a 
party is responsible for undermining the integrity of the judicial process be-
cause it chose to recklessly present misleading or false evidence to the court 
and the court’s judgment was influenced by the conduct at issue, the judgment 
should be set aside as a fraud on the court.

[Vol. 16:707  
Accordingly, lawyers that use information obtained through discovery that 
has no basis in law or fact to support motions filed with the court are clearly 
misleading the court, even if they have no intent to defraud the court. Indeed, 
“an attorney might commit fraud upon the court by instituting an action ‘to 
which he knew [or should have known] there was a complete defense.’ ”208 
Similarly, lawyers that choose to conduct discovery without making an inquiry 
reasonable under the circumstances and then present false or misleading infor-
mation to the court in order to obtain a favorable judgment may be guilty of 
fraud on the court. For example, kneejerk discovery requests served without 
consideration of existing law can, and should, rise to the level of fraud on the 
court under Rule 60(d)(3) if the court is influenced by the discovery that was 
improperly obtained. 
Some cases may be opening the door for a more relaxed approach to the 
conduct component. For example, in Eastern Financing Corporation v. JSC 
Alchevsk Iron and Steel Works,209 the court found that an attorney committed 
fraud on the court when he filed a motion for default judgment.210 Absent from 
the court’s opinion is any analysis of the attorney’s intent.211 Instead, the court 
focuses on a few areas of conduct that suggest a more relaxed approach to the 
fraud on the court standard.212 Admittedly, the case does not involve abusive 
discovery, but it is illustrative of a softened approach when analyzing whether 
certain conduct rises to the level of fraud on the court. 
Of particular importance in Eastern Financing is the court’s continued ref-
erence to Rule 11 violations and a lawyer’s duty to conduct a reasonable in-
quiry before filing documents with the court. Interestingly, Rule 11 does not 
speak to fraud, nor does a violation of Rule 11 require the movant to prove in-
tent. Yet the court seemed content relying, at least in part, on this rule to find 
that a fraud on the court had occurred.213 In fact, a Rule 11 violation can occur 
when an attorney acts recklessly. Indeed, the court found that the attorney filed 
the complaint “without making an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances 
as required under Rule 11(b).”214 The court held that this was “irresponsible” 
for the attorney to rely on his client’s “oral recitation of facts” in preparing the 
complaint.215  
The most compelling evidence against the attorney, however, was that he 
knowingly sponsored his client’s nondisclosure and misrepresentations when

verifying the complaint and then filing the motion for default judgment.216 That 
alone was enough for the court to find that the attorney committed a fraud on 
the court.217 The court also found that a letter submitted by the attorney to the 
court that failed to make mention of a pending bankruptcy case was “less than 
honest dealing with the court.”218 When discussing the party’s conduct that 
contributed to a Rule 11 violation, the court said his submissions to the court 
show that he is “careless with facts and often misleading, and that he relies on 
suspicion and hearsay.”219 Absent again from the court’s analysis, however, is 
any reference to intentional fraudulent conduct specifically directed at the court 
itself.220 Notably, the court continued to analyze the very question posed by this 
Article: did the conduct at issue cause the court not to perform in the usual 
manner its impartial task of adjudging cases?221 
In further support of a lightened standard, courts that have analyzed fraud 
on the court claims consistently refer to the “fraud, misrepresentation, or con-
duct” that occurred in procuring the judgment.222 Again, suggesting that inten-
tional fraudulent conduct specifically directed at the court is not a prerequisite 
to a successful fraud on the court claim. Even the Supreme Court in Hazel-
Atlas stated that “[t]he public welfare demands that the agencies of public jus-
tice be not so impotent that they must always be mute and helpless victims of 
deception and fraud.”223 There is no plausible explanation why a claim for 
fraud on the court cannot stand when the deception or misconduct occurs be-
tween the litigants during discovery and then, at some point during the case, the 
conduct at issue impedes the court from performing in the usual manner its im-
partial task of adjudging the case. 
C.   Consideration of the Victim’s Status (The Equitable Component) 
The doctrine of fraud on the court allows courts to provide equitable relief. 
Indeed, “the doctrine of fraud on the court is a judicially devised equitable doc-

trine, the application of which is dependent on the facts of the case.”224 In Ha-
zel-Atlas, the Court noted, 
Equitable relief against fraudulent judgments is not of statutory creation. It 
is a judicially devised remedy fashioned to relieve hardships which, from time to 
time, arise from a hard and fast adherence to another court-made rule, the gen-
eral rule that judgments should not be disturbed after the term of their entry has 
expired. Created to avert the evils of archaic rigidity, this equitable procedure 
has always been characterized by flexibility which enables it to meet new situa-
tions which demand equitable intervention, and to accord all the relief neces-
sary to correct the particular injustices involved in these situations.225 
Notwithstanding, some courts have held that even if a party can demon-
strate conduct that caused the court not to perform in the usual manner its im-
partial task of adjudging a case, “[a]ny issues that may have been ‘addressed 
through the unimpeded adversary process’ are not appropriately attacked on the 
basis of fraud upon the court.”226 For example, in Gleason v. Jandrucko, the 
court found no fraud on the court where the plaintiff had an opportunity to ex-
pose misrepresentations made in discovery at trial.227 There, the plaintiff moved 
under Rule 60 after the plaintiff’s case was dismissed.228 The plaintiff argued 
that the officers in the case lied during their depositions about having probable 
cause; however, the district court found that the plaintiff had opportunity to ex-
pose those inconsistencies during trial and failed to do so.229 Other courts have 
stated that allegations of an opposing counsel’s intentional mischaracterization 
of the applicable law, evidence, or affidavits submitted to the court does not 
rise to the level of fraud on the court if the movant’s own counsel could have 
rebutted opposing counsel’s mischaracterization of the law and the record be-
fore the court.230 
This harsh approach is unreasonable, especially if courts consider the vic-
tim. The Supreme Court in Hazel-Atlas made it clear that the fraud-on-the-court 
rule should be characterized by flexibility and an ability to meet new situations 
demanding equitable intervention.231 Because of the equitable and flexible na-
ture of the rule, this Article contends that courts have ample leeway and discre-
tion to consider the victim’s status—i.e., those parties unable to recognize or 
combat the fraud prejudgment—in determining whether to set aside a judgment 
for fraud on the court.

FRAUD ON THE COURT 
737 
Is it fair to suggest that pro se litigants or attorney-abandoned litigants have 
a duty to root out all evil during the discovery process and that any issues that 
could have been addressed cannot be appropriately attacked on the basis of 
fraud on the court? Should courts deny these victims relief because they should 
have, for example, rebutted opposing counsel’s mischaracterization of the law 
and the record before the court? Or should courts, equipped with equitable 
power to correct transgressions that occur before them, recognize that often-
times victims of abusive discovery lack both the skill and knowledge to uncov-
er misconduct during discovery or at trial? Pro se litigants and attorney-
abandoned litigants do not have the tools to combat abusive discovery. These 
victims do not understand what a deemed admission means. These victims do 
not understand how interrogatories can be used fraudulently to support a mo-
tion for summary judgment. These victims do not understand how the rules of 
civil procedure can be employed to thwart abusive discovery before it is too 
late. 
Because courts are endowed with the power to ascertain whether their 
judgments were obtained by fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct, the 
victim’s status should be a consideration. The fact that the misconduct could 
have been rooted out during discovery should be insignificant in most cases, 
but it should be especially inconsequential when an attorney does not represent 
the victim involved. Actions involving these sorts of victims should be gov-
erned by even more flexibility to afford necessary relief. The harsh standard 
other courts have employed should not be the current view because it is contra-
ry to the equitable principles behind the relief afforded by Rule 60(d)(3).  
D.   Consideration of the Relief Being Sought  
Interestingly, although Rule 60(d)(3) is the only rule that even mentions the 
fraud-on-the-court doctrine, other Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including 
Rules 11, 16, 26, 37, and 41, have been cited in applying the doctrine. For ex-
ample, courts have dismissed, defaulted, and sanctioned litigants for fraud on 
the court, and have found the necessary authority outside of Rule 60(d)(3)—
often citing the inherent power given to all courts to fashion appropriate reme-
dies and sanctions for conduct which abuses the judicial process.232 Some 
courts have premised dismissal or default of a litigant who committed fraud on 
the court entirely on Rule 11.233 Other courts have relied on Rule 41(b) for au-
thority to dismiss a plaintiff who has committed fraud on the court.234 Rule

poena, was “totally at odds with the . . . notions of fairness central to our system of litiga-
tion”).

41(b) provides the court with authority to dismiss a case if a plaintiff fails to 
comply with the rules of civil procedure or other court orders.235 Such a dismis-
sal operates as an adjudication on the merits.236 This rule, however, has no im-
port if the offending party has already obtained a judgment. 
The problem with the widespread use of the fraud-on-the-court doctrine is 
that courts continue to apply the heightened standard to prove a fraud on the 
court has occurred, yet the remedies and relief that flow from making such a 
finding can be entirely different. As one court observed, 
When a fraud on the court is shown through clear and convincing evidence to 
have been committed in an ongoing case, the trial judge has the inherent power 
to take action in response to the fraudulent conduct. The judge has broad discre-
tion to fashion a judicial response warranted by the fraudulent conduct. Dismis-
sal of claims or of an entire action may be warranted by the fraud, as may be the 
entry of a default judgment.237 
 The First Circuit has examined the options of a federal district judge con-
fronted by fraud on the court and has held that federal courts possess the inher-
ent power to “order dismissal or default where a litigant has stooped to the level 
of fraud on the court.”238 It stated the following: 
All in all, we find it surpassingly difficult to conceive of a more appropriate use 
of a court’s inherent power than to protect the sanctity of the judicial process—
to combat those who would dare to practice unmitigated fraud upon the court it-
self. To deny the existence of such power would, we think, foster the very impo-
tency against which the Hazel-Atlas Court specifically warned.239  
Rule 60(d)(3), however, only serves one purpose: to “set aside a judgment 
for fraud on the court.”240 Setting aside a judgment is different from dismissing 
a claim, an entire action, or entering a default judgment. “[D]ismissal sounds 
‘the death knell of the lawsuit’ ”241 and is an extreme remedy that “must be ex-
ercised with restraint and discretion.”242 On the other hand, Rule 60 enables 
courts to set aside judgments when necessary to accomplish justice and return 
the parties to the status quo that existed prior to the misconduct. In other words, 
Rule 60(d)(3) does not mandate a court to set aside a judgment and dismiss the 
entire case with prejudice. While dismissal with prejudice is certainly an op-
tion,243 it is not a mandate created by Rule 60(d)(3). Courts repeatedly hold that

FRAUD ON THE COURT

cases are to be tried on the merits if possible.244 Thus, based on the indiscretion 
at issue, courts may set aside the judgment and additionally take any of the fol-
lowing actions: (1) require a trial on the merits unblemished by the misconduct, 
(2) sanction the offending party, (3) dismiss a particular cause of action, or (4) 
dismiss the entire proceeding with prejudice.  
The bottom line is that fraud on the court can take many forms and the 
standard for setting aside a judgment for fraud on the court under Rule 60(d) 
ought to be flexible. The options afforded to courts confronted by attorney mis-
conduct suggest that courts can and should focus on the egregiousness of the 
conduct and the relief being sought. While some misconduct might fall short of 
furnishing a basis for setting aside a judgment and dismissal with prejudice, 
other indiscretions may warrant such a harsh remedy. Courts possess plenary 
authority “to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expedi-
tious disposition of cases.”245 As a result, examination of the options of the 
court confronted by misconduct—whether that is taking additional steps be-
yond setting aside the judgment such as ordering dismissal or imposing sanc-
tions—is an important component to process litigation to a just and equitable 
conclusion.  
E.   Illustration of the Four-Part Test  
The Fallini case cited above provides a logical illustration of the four-part 
test for several reasons. First, it involved alleged misconduct by an officer of 
the court.246 Second, the alleged misconduct originated during the discovery 
process.247 Third, the attorney abandoned the victim when the misconduct tran-
spired.248 And finally, the conduct caused the court not to perform in the usual 
manner its impartial task of adjudging the case, because the court never heard 
the merits, but instead entered an order based on a false admission.249 
In order to address the misconduct in Fallini, the victim hired a new attor-
ney and on May 21, 2014, filed a motion for relief from judgment under Rule 
60. It alleged that plaintiff’s counsel “knowingly forced fraudulent facts on the 
                                                                                                                                 
versal must be finally dismissed. No principle is better settled than the maxim that he who 
comes into equity must come with clean hands and keep them clean throughout the course of 
the litigation, and that if he violates this rule, he must be denied all relief whatever may have 
been the merits of his claim”).

es should be tried on the merits rather than the technicalities of pleadings”) (citation omit-

court and failed to correct misrepresentations thereby committing fraud upon 
the court.”250  
1.   The Offending Party and His Duty 
The court, in addressing whether fraud on the court occurred under Rule 
60, focused on the offending party—plaintiff’s lawyer—and noted that “as an 
officer of the court, [he] had a duty to not mislead the court or fail to correct a 
misrepresentation.”251 It held that “[s]imple dishonesty of any attorney is so 
damaging on courts and litigants that it is considered fraud upon the court.”252 
And, citing to rules of professional conduct, the court further held that “[a]n of-
ficer of the court perpetrates fraud on the court a) through an act that is calcu-
lated to mislead the court or b) by failing to correct a misrepresentation or re-
tract false evidence submitted to the court.”253 
2.   The Conduct 
The court next focused on the conduct at issue. Interestingly, the attorney 
in Fallini denied knowing that the accident occurred on open range,254 which 
may have been an attempt to refute that any intentional misconduct occurred. 
After considering the evidence, however, the court found that the attorney 
“knew or should have known the accident occurred on open range prior to filing 
his request for admissions.”255 The court also found that “[a]t the bare mini-
mum, [the attorney] possessed enough information to conduct a reasonable in-
quiry into the open range status of the location where the accident occurred.”256 
Despite this knowledge, the attorney sought an admission from Fallini stating 
that the area where the accident occurred was not open range, a false fact that 
was deemed admitted when Fallini’s attorney failed to respond.257  
Thus, as an officer of the court, the attorney violated his duty of candor un-
der the rules of professional conduct “by utilizing Defendant’s denial that the 
accident occurred on open range to obtain a favorable ruling in the form of an 
unopposed award of summary judgment.”258 Consequently, the court found a 
violation of Rule 60(b) because “Plaintiff’s request for admission of a known 
fact, a fact that was a central component of Defendant’s case, was done when

counsel knew or should have known that the accident did not occur on open 
range, thereby perpetrating fraud upon the court.”259 
3.   The Victim 
The court also considered the victim in this case. It noted that the attorney 
who committed the fraud on the court “may argue that all [Fallini’s prior attor-
ney] had to do was simply ‘deny’ the request for admissions.”260 While this is 
certainly true, the court took special consideration of the fact that Fallini’s prior 
attorney failed “to respond to various motions and requests to the extent that 
[plaintiff’s attorney] knew or should have known that a response from [Fallini’s 
attorney] was unlikely.”261 
The court also recognized the maxim the Supreme Court expressed in Ha-
zel-Atlas: the fraud-on-the-court rule should be characterized by flexibility and 
an ability to meet new situations demanding equitable intervention.262 The 
court clearly considered and accepted the inequities of the case, as it acknowl-
edged that “one cannot ignore the apparent injustice that Defendant has suf-
fered throughout this matter. Ms. Fallini [was] responsible for a multi-million 
dollar judgment without the merits of the case even being addressed.”263 In oth-
er words, it was significant to the court that Fallini’s attorney had abandoned 
her, and this certainly influenced, at least in part, the court’s decision to set 
aside the judgment due to a fraud on the court.  
4.   The Relief  
The court recognized that “[f]inality has a particular importance in our le-
gal system.”264 However, it also noted that a final judgment is one “that dispos-
es of the issues presented in the case, determines the costs, and leaves nothing 
for future consideration of the court.”265 But “the issues presented in this case 
were summarily disposed above due to the negligence of Defendant’s counsel 
. . . [and] [t]he merits of the case were never actually addressed.”266 Again, rec-
ognizing the victim’s status, the court found that had Fallini’s attorney “proper-
ly denied the improper request for admissions, the outcome may have been 
much different.”267 
The court’s order states several times throughout that “cases are to be heard 
on the merits if possible” and that Fallini was unjustly punished without the

merits of the case ever being addressed.268 In addition to its express authority to 
set aside the judgment under Rule 60, the court clearly had the authority to or-
der further relief, such as sanctions or dismissal with prejudice.269 Pursuant to 
the court’s Order Granting Motion for Entry of Final Judgment and Dismissing 
Case with Prejudice, the court entered final judgment in favor of Fallini and 
dismissed the case with prejudice.270  
CONCLUSION 
While finality of judgment matters, no worthwhile interest is served in pro-
tecting judgments obtained by misconduct. The Federal Rules of Civil Proce-
dure contemplate liberal discovery, but the potential for discovery abuse is ev-
er-present. There are rules in place to remedy abusive discovery, yet those rules 
are only functional during litigation—they serve no purpose post-judgment. 
Thus, cheaters are prospering under the judicial system, especially against vul-
nerable victims that lack both the skill and knowledge to adequately prepare a 
defense or thwart the abusive conduct before an unfavorable judgment is ren-
dered.  
Rule 60(d)(3), however, allows a court to set aside judgments—judgments 
obtained years earlier—which have been secured by a fraud on the court. But to 
succeed in setting aside a judgment, several courts require a showing, by clear 
and convincing evidence, of intentional fraudulent conduct specifically directed 
at the court itself. This standard is too high. If federal courts were compelled to 
follow this standard, nearly every claim of abusive discovery would fail. How-
ever, the remedial and equitable nature of the fraud-on-the-court doctrine and 
the great public policy that it embodies militates against making that burden an 
impossible hurdle for victims of abusive discovery. 
Fraud on the court can take many forms. Fortunately, the fraud-on-the-
court rule that the United States Supreme Court articulated in Hazel-Atlas 
should be characterized by flexibility and an ability to meet new situations de-
manding equitable intervention. The equitable and flexible nature of the rule 
supports the contention that the current standard for evaluating fraud on the 
court is flawed. The four-step step process outlined above—with the ultimate 
inquiry of whether the abusive conduct caused the court not to perform in the 
usual manner its impartial task of adjudging cases—further facilitates a court’s 
inherent power to do whatever is reasonably necessary to deter abuse of the ju-
dicial process.
