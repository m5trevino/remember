Understanding AB 1482: California’s Tenant Protection Act Explained
The California Tenant Protection Act, also known as Assembly Bill 1482, was enacted to provide protection for renters in California.
This state law limits the amount by which rent can be increased each year, based on the Consumer Price Index or 5%, whichever is lower. It also imposes restrictions on a landlord’s ability to evict tenants, requiring a valid reason to terminate a tenancy. Landlords are required to give notice to terminate a tenancy, and they must also provide a notice of exemption if the property is not subject to the rent limits imposed by Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code.
The law applies to properties that have been rented out for at least 12 months and does not cover properties subject to local rent control ordinances.
Additionally, properties rented out for 24 months are exempt from AB 1482. Landlords of properties subject to the law are required to include an addendum explaining the rent control law in their lease agreements. The California Apartment Association and other rent control law advocates have expressed support for this legislation, which aims to address the rising cost of living in the state.
Navigating AB 1482: A Tenant’s Guide to California Rent Control
As of January 1, 2020, the California Tenant Protection Act (Assembly Bill 1482) went into effect, bringing statewide rent control to California. This means that if you are a tenant living in a property for 12 months or more, your landlord is now subject to the rent limits imposed by Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code. The law limits the amount your rent can increase annually to either 5% plus the Consumer Price Index (CPI), or 10%, whichever is lower.
If your property is not subject to the statewide rent control law, it may still fall under local rent control ordinances. Landlords who are exempt from AB 1482 include those who have owned the property for 24 months or less, or for a duplex in which they live in one of the units. Additionally, properties owned by a company in which at least one member is a corporation are also exempt from the law’s restrictions.
According to Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code, a landlord must give tenants a notice to terminate a tenancy if they wish to end a tenancy for reasons other than non-payment of rent or lease violations. Tenants have the right to challenge any eviction attempts that do not comply with state law, ensuring that they are protected from unjustified evictions.
It is important for tenants to be aware of their rights under California rent control laws and to stay informed about any changes or updates. Tenants can protect themselves and make sure that landlords who want to get around the protections put in place by the state of California don’t take advantage of them by understanding the rules outlined in AB 1482.
Demystifying AB 1482: Key Exemptions and Rent Caps Explained
Demystifying AB 1482: Key Exemptions and Rent Caps Explained The California Tenant Protection Act, also known as Assembly Bill 1482, has brought significant changes to rent control laws in the state of California. One key aspect of AB 1482 is the imposition of rent caps on certain types of properties. Under this state law, annual rent increases are limited to whichever is lower: 5% plus the local consumer price index, or 10%.
This law limits the amount by which rent can be increased, providing much-needed relief for tenants facing skyrocketing housing costs. Additionally, certain properties are exempt from AB 1482, such as those subject to the rent limits imposed by Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code. These exemptions allow landlords to continue evicting tenants under specific circumstances, providing flexibility in managing their properties.
One common exemption from AB 1482 is for properties that have been rented to the same tenants for at least 12 months. In such cases, landlords are allowed to terminate a tenancy without cause, provided they give the required notice to terminate a tenancy.
Another exemption applies to properties rented to tenants for 24 months or more, allowing landlords to increase rent beyond the statewide rent cap. Landlords must provide tenants with a notice of exemption to inform them of their rights under the law. Understanding these exemptions is crucial for landlords and tenants alike to navigate the complexities of California’s rent control laws.
