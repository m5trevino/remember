I
n general, you can only ask for a clerk judgment if the case was about a contract or an open book account. In those cases, if the contract makes clear what you're owed, the clerk may be able to process the judgment. In other cases, you'll need a court judgment so a judge can review what you've asked for.
For more help, you can use the step-by-step guides from the Sacramento County Law Library.
These explain the process and forms you can use, though your local court may have different forms for you to use.
