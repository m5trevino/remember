Language Justice
The LA Tenants Union believes in language justice, which includes the right that everyone has to communicate, to understand, and be understood in the language(s) they feel most comfortable using. We strive to make our communication, as well as meetings and actions, fully bilingual in Spanish and English, and in the future hope to incorporate other languages to create a multilingual housing justice movement. Language justice is a collective responsibility to create inclusive spaces where folks of different backgrounds can listen to each other and participate fully to build power toward a movement that truly represents our city.
