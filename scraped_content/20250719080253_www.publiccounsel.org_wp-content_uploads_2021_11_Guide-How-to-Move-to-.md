CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA: WESTERN DIVISION
How to Move to Set Aside Entry of Default 
If you fail to file a response to a lawsuit in time, the plaintiff can ask the Court to enter “default”
against you. When the Court enters default against you, you no longer have the right to oppose the
lawsuit. To regain the right to oppose the lawsuit, you must file a Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default.
To file a Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of
California, you will need to prepare the following documents:
1)
Notice of Motion and Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default
2)
Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default
3)
Defendant’s Declaration in Support of Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default
4)
(Proposed) Order
5)
Proof of Service by Mail
A template of each of these document is included with this guide.
Description of Each Document
1)
Notice of Motion and Motion to Aside Entry of Default
The Notice of Motion and Motion lets the Court and the opposing party know what kind of
motion you are making.
2)
Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default
The Memorandum of Points and Authorities contains your legal argument for why the Court
should set aside the default. In your Memorandum, you must show the Court that (1) you had
a good reason for not responding to the lawsuit in time, (2) you have a defense to the lawsuit,
and (3) your delay has not harmed the plaintiff’s ability to pursue the lawsuit. The
Memorandum of Points and Authorities must not exceed 25 pages.
3)
Declaration in Support of Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default
A Declaration is a sworn statement to the Court where you write the facts that support your
motion.
4)
(Proposed) Order
This is an Order for the judge to sign if he or she wants to grant your motion. You do not sign
the proposed order—instead, you leave a space for the judge’s signature.

Proof of Service by Mail
In this document, you or someone else will swear to the Court that you have mailed a copy of
the motion documents to the opposing counsel.
Meeting and Conferring with Opposing Counsel Prior to Filing Your Motion
Before you can file the Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default, you are required to call the opposing
counsel (the lawyer for the plaintiff) to explain that you wish to set aside the default. You must do this
7 days before filing your motion. You will include the date on which you talked to opposing counsel in
the last paragraph of your Notice of Motion and Motion to Set Aside Entry of Default.
The purpose of this rule is to encourage parties to resolve problems without having to resort to a
formal motion. Do not be afraid to ask opposing counsel to agree to set aside the default. If the
opposing counsel says no, explain that you will then file a formal motion with the Court.
Scheduling a Hearing Date
When you file a written motion, you must propose a hearing date—a date on which you and the
other party must appear before the judge assigned to your case to orally argue about the motion. In
the Central District of California, the date must be at least 31 days after the date you file the motion
and serve a copy by mail. You will write this date under the title of your motion (see the sample on the
next page). Note, however, that judges will often move a scheduled hearing date or cancel the
hearing altogether and decide the motion based only on the written documents.
To schedule a motion date, you must look at your judge’s schedule and find out when the judge
hears civil motions. To find this information online, do the following:
1)
Go to the Central District’s website, at http://www.cacd.uscourts.gov.
2)
On the left hand side of the website, you will find a list of links. Click on the link called “Judges
Procedures and Schedules.”
3)
Click on your judge’s name.
4)
Read your judge’s procedures, and look for the day that he or she hears civil motions. For
example, your judge may hear civil motions every Monday at 1:30 p.m. If that is the case, you
must propose a hearing date on a Monday that is 31 days or more after the day you file your
motion.
5)
Towards the beginning of each judge’s page, there is a link that says, “Click here to view Closed
Motion Dates.” That page lists the dates on which each judge will not be hearing motions. Click
that link to make sure that you are not scheduling a hearing on a closed motion date.
If you do not have internet access, you should call the courtroom deputy (CRD) for the judge
assigned to your case.

Updating the Table of Contents and Table of Authorities (Microsoft Word Users Only)
The sample Memorandum of Points and Authorities included in this guide includes a Table of
Contents and a Table of Authorities. As you add your facts to the Memorandum, you may find that the
page numbers for everything will change. To update the page numbers for the Table of Contents and
Table of Authorities, do the following:
1)
Right-click on each table.
2)
Select “Update Field.”
3)
If asked, select, “Update entire table.”
NOTE: Be sure to complete the above process for the Table of Contents and both the “Cases” and
“Statutes” sections of the Table of Authorities.
Filing and Serving Your Motion
When you have completed your motion, you must file it with the Civil Intake Division of the
courthouse in which the judge who is hearing your motion is located. The Civil Intake Division requires
1 original and 2 copies of each document you wish to file. In addition, send 1 copy of each document
to the opposing counsel by mail on the same day that you file.
You may file your motion with the court in person or by mail. Keep in mind that mailing your
motion may delay the date on which it is filed. The addresses for the Civil Intake Division for the
Central District of California courthouses are as follows:
LOS ANGELES

Any opposition to a motion must be filed no later than 21 days before the motion hearing
date. The person who made the motion is not required to reply to an opposition. Those who wish to
reply, however, must do so no later than 14 days before the motion hearing date. You may title the
reply, “Reply to Opposition to Motion to (insert the title of your motion).”
A reply should be short. Some judges impose page limits on replies. Be sure to read any
orders issued by your judge carefully to make sure you are complying with your judge’s rules

III.
ARGUMENT
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(c) provides that an entry of default may
be set aside upon a showing of good cause. Fed. R. Civ. P. 55(c). The Ninth
Circuit’s good cause standard for setting aside entry of default is the same as that
for setting aside default judgment under Rule 60(b), but the test for setting aside
entry of default is less rigid and is more generous to the party in default.
Franchise Holding II, LLC v. Huntington Rests. Group, Inc., 375 F.3d 922, 925
(9th Cir. 2004).

The Court considers three factors when deciding whether to set aside
default:  (1) whether the defendant’s culpable conduct led to the default; (2)
whether the defendant has a meritorious defense; and (3) whether setting aside
default would prejudice the plaintiff. Id. at 925-26. In addition, “[t]he law does
not favor defaults,” and “therefore, any doubts as to whether a party is in default
should be decided in favor of the defaulting party.” Bonita Packing Co. v.
O’Sullivan, 165 F.R.D. 610, 614 (C.D. Cal. 1995).
A.
Defendant’s Delay in Responding to the Lawsuit was Not
Culpable.
In the Ninth Circuit, analysis of “culpability” for the purposes of
demonstrating “good cause” under Rule 55(c) overlaps with the standard for
“excusable neglect” under Rule 60(b)(1). TCI Group Life Ins. Plan v. Knoebber,
244 F.3d 691, 696 (9th Cir. 2001) (questioned on other grounds); also see
Meadows v. Dominican Republic, 817 F.2d 517, 522 (9th Cir. 1987) (finding that
the conduct of defendants in district court was culpable because defendants were
aware of federal law, and their intentional failure to respond to the action was not
excusable neglect). The Ninth Circuit finds a negligent failure to respond
excusable if the defaulting party offers a credible, good-faith explanation for the
delay that negates “any intention to take advantage of the opposing party, interfere
with judicial decision-making, or otherwise manipulate the legal process.”
Knoebber, 244 F.3d at 697-98. Further, in analyzing culpability, the Court may
consider a defendant’s exigent personal matters, his mental state, and his lack of
familiarity with legal matters. See id. at 699 (finding defendant’s delay in
response not culpable because she was grieving the death of her husband and was
not familiar with the legal system).

Defendant had no intent to gain an advantage over the opposing party or to
delay legal proceedings. As Defendant’s delay in response was due to excusable
neglect, the Court should find that Defendant’s conduct was not culpable.
B.
Defendant Has a Meritorious Defense to the Lawsuit.
A defense is considered meritorious if “there is some possibility that the
outcome of the suit after a full trial will be contrary to the result achieved by the
default.” Hawaii Carpenters’ Trust Funds v. Stone, 794 F.2d 508, 513 (9th Cir.
1986). All that is required is an assertion of “a factual or legal basis that is
sufficient to raise a particular defense; the question of whether a particular factual
allegation is true is resolved at a later stage.” Audio Toys, Inc. v. Smart AV Pty
Ltd., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 44078, *8 (N.D. Cal. June 6, 2007).
Defendant has the following defenses to this lawsuit:

If Defendant prevails on these defenses, the outcome would be contrary to
the result achieved by default. Therefore, Defendant has set forth a meritorious
defense and satisfies the second good cause factor.
C.
Plaintiff Will Not Suffer Prejudice If Entry of Default Is Set
Aside.
Prejudice is determined by whether a party will be hindered in pursuing its
claim. See Knoebber, 244 F.3d at 701. The fact that a party may be denied a
quick victory is not sufficient to deny relief from default judgment. Bateman v.
United States Postal Service, 231 F.3d 1220, 1225 (9th Cir. 2000). “The delay
must result in tangible harm such as loss of evidence, increased difficulties of
discovery, or greater opportunity for fraud or collusion.” Audio Toys, 2007 U.S.
Dist. LEXIS at *9.

Allowing the case to move forward on the merits after only a short delay
should not prejudice Plaintiff’s ability to litigate its case. The only prejudice that
might result to Plaintiff by a denial of default judgment is that Plaintiff will not be
able to ensure an easy victory. As no prejudice will result to Plaintiff in
reopening this case, the third and final good cause factor is satisfied.
Defendant is ready and willing to litigate this lawsuit. Defendant’s delay
in responding was not culpable, Defendant has meritorious defenses, and Plaintiff
will not suffer any prejudice in pursuing its claims if default is set aside.
Therefore, Defendant has met the good cause standard of Rule 55(c) and this
Court should set aside the entry of default against him.
IV.
CONCLUSION
Based on the above reasons, this Court should grant Defendant’s motion.
