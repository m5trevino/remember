If you are a landlord and want to evict a tenant:
Step One: Is there a local ordinance that is more protective of the tenant?  (see Local Ordinance box above)
If there is a local ordinance that governs, you must follow it. If there is not a local ordinance, continue on to step 2 and 3 to determine if the State Tenant Protection Act eviction protections apply.
______________________________________
Determining if the Tenant Protection Act eviction protections apply to your situation is a multi-step process. If eviction protection applies, then the landlord must have "just cause" (see
Just Cause Eviction tab
) and proper notice (see
Notice tab
) must be given.
Step Two: Is the tenancy covered by eviction protection?
Occupancy:
Has the tenant continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 12 or more months?
If there is more than one adult tenant, have all tenants continually and lawfully occupied the property for 12 or more months, or at least one tenant continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 24 months or more?
If the tenant has
NOT
lawfully and continuously occupied the residential real property for 12 months or more, then the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 does not apply. If an adult tenant is added to the lease before the existing tenant has continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 24 months, the Tenant Protection Act only applies if either, all tenants have continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 12 or more months or if one or more tenants have continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 24 months or more.
Civil Code §1946.2(a)
.
If the tenant(s) does not meet the occupancy requirement, they are not covered by the Tenant Protection Act. This means that as a landlord you do not have to have "just cause" (see
Just Cause Evictions tab
) to evict the tenant(s). If the tenant(s) meets the occupancy requirement and the type of property is not listed in the exemptions below, then the landlord must have "just cause" (see
Just Cause Evictions tab
) and provide proper notice (see
Notice tab
).
Step Three: Is the unit the type covered by eviction protection?
All units in California have eviction protection,
except
the following:
Types of Residential Properties & Circumstances
1. Affordable housing or housing subject to an agreement that provides housing subsidies for affordable housing as defined in
Health & Safety Code § 50093
, or comparable federal statutes.
2. Newer housing; issued a certificate of occupancy within the previous 15 years, unless the housing is a mobilehome.
3. Residential real property with separate title for each dwelling unit (e.g.: single-family home on a single lot, condominium, mobilehome, residential flat in a commercial building),
provided that both of the following apply
:
The owner is not a real estate investment trust, as defined in
Internal Revenue Code § 856
, a corporation, a limited liability company in which at least one member is a corporation, management of a mobilehome park as defined in
Civil Code § 798.2
.;
and
The tenants were provided written notice that the residential property is exempt using the exact statutory language stated in either
Civil Code § 1947.12(d)
or
Civil Code § 1946.2(e)
.
See Exempt Notice in box to the left for sample.
4. A duplex (property containing two separate dwelling units within a single structure) where the owner occupied one of the units as their principal place of residence at the beginning of the tenancy and continues to occupy it and neither is an accessory dwelling unit or a junior accessory dwelling unit.
7. Dormitories owned and operated by an institution of higher education or a kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive, school. (Note: There is a similar exemption governing rent controls, but it is narrower than this one for evictions.)
5. Transient and tourist hotel occupancy as defined in
Civil Code § 1940(b)
.
6. Housing accommodations in a nonprofit hospital, religious facility, extended care facility, or licensed residential care facility for the elderly, as defined in
Health & Safety Code §1569.2
, or an adult residential facility as defined in
Title 22, Division 6, Chapter 6 of the State Dept. of Social Services Manual of Policies & Procedures
.
7. Dormitories owned and operated by an institution of higher education or a kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive, school. (Note: There is a similar exemption in the law governing rent controls, but that one is narrower than this one for evictions.)
8. Housing accommodations where the tenant shares bathroom or kitchen facilities with the owner who maintains their principal residence at the residential property.
9. A residence where the owner-occupant rents or leases no more than two units or bedrooms, including but not limited to, an accessory dwelling unit or a junior accessory dwelling unit.
10. In addition to the above exemptions, the Tenant Protection Act does not preempt local just cause ordinances, depending on when they were adopted.
If the type of property or circumstance is listed above, then the Tenant Protection Act does not apply. This means that as a landlord you do not have to have "just cause" (see
Just Cause Evictions tab
) to evict the tenant(s).
Next: If you determine that the tenant meets the occupancy requirements AND the property type is not one of the categories listed above, move on to the
Just Cause Evictions tab
