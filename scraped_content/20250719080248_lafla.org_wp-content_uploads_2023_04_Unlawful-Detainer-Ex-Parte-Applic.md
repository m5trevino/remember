General Information to Set Aside a UD Default Judgment
Once a default judgment has been entered, it may be difficult to set aside that judgment and halt an 
eviction. You may need to demonstrate that you were prevented from filing an answer or attending your 
trial for reasons that the court will accept. If the court grants your motion and signs that order, you may 
be potentially given another chance to properly file an Answer on your own behalf in the case.
ONCE THE SHERIFF LOCKS YOU OUT, IT MAY BE TOO LATE TO FILE THESE 
DOCUMENTS! 
You may apply to have the eviction “stayed” and the default judgment set aside, but only BEFORE 
the sheriff executes the lock-out.  The courts typically will only review motions if it retains the power to do 
so.  Why? One reason is because new people may be living there already.
Filing an Ex Parte/Motion to Set Aside DOES NOT delay the Sheriff Lock-Out.  Only an Order from the 
Court can stop the Sheriff Lock-Out. If you do not agree with this guide or have other questions,
CONTACT a licensed attorney immediately for legal assistance!
What is a Default Judgment? 
A default judgment (automatic loss) is a judgment entered against the other party usually because the other 
party failed to take 
some 
action 
required 
by 
law. 
To 
illustrate 
the 
concept, 
imagine 
a 
basketball game. The Landlord/Plaintiff is the Home Team, and the Tenant/Defendant is the Visiting 
Team. If the Visiting Team does not show up on time for the game, we would say that they have forfeited, 
and lost by default.  
Why the Court Enters Default Judgments? 
Usually, the Court enters a default and/or default judgment when defendants have: 

failed to file a written Answer to the complaint with the court on time, or

failed to “appear” (present themselves) for their trial at the appointed date and time.
A. Failing to file a written Answer with the Court
•
It is usually not sufficient grounds to say you did not know you had to file an answer
o
The Summons informs you that you have only five (5) court days to file a written Answer.
o
Also, the Court mails a 1-page courtesy notice telling you that an eviction lawsuit has been
filed;
Most importantly, the Court may stay the eviction & set aside the default only when it finds that you 
have proven that, through no fault of your own, you were prevented from filing an answer for some 
very good reasons.   Some examples are: 

you were not served with a copy of the Summons and Complaint; or

if you have been served with a copy, you were nonetheless prevented from filing your Answer
because of fraud, surprise, mistake, excusable neglect or inadvertence beyond your control;

if you were hospitalized or bedridden and could not file a timely answer (you will need to establish
this by your declaration and your hospitalization records or a doctor’s note);

if the landlord’s actions (i.e. accepted your rent, etc.) led you to believe that you did not have to file
an answer; (you will need to establish this by declarations and any documentary evidence)
EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR STAY FOR
EXECUTION OF JUDGMENT  
2
B. Failing to attend your trial

Failure to attend because you did not receive the Notice of Trial in the mail is difficult to prove.
The court internally schedules the trial dates after a party requests it and sends a two-page notice 
in the mail to the parties.   Sometimes the tenant does not know about the trial date and misses it.   
At that time, the Court will automatically find for the Plaintiff/Landlord and enter a default judgment 
against the tenant/defendant.     
•
If you received the notice but were unable to attend because of an unexpected hospitalization or
illness (you will need to establish this by hospital or doctor records in addition to your declaration.)
•
If you got into an accident on the way to court;
•
If you did not get the Notice in the mail because it was incorrectly addressed, other people have
access to your mail, or the post office lost it;
II.
What you will need if you did not file a written Answer with the
Court on time:
Get copies of these following documents:
□Summons and Complaint—including its Exhibits (attached documents – Notice, Lease/rental
agreement, proof of service of the notice);
□Request for Entry of Default—including a request for either a Clerk’s Judgment (for possession
only) or for a Court’s Judgment (includes a judgment for money).
□Proof of Service of Summons—there may be multiple Proofs of Service of Summons. Obtain
them all including for “All Unknown Occupants.”
□Civil Case Summary – the court index/summary of action or documents in the file.
Once you have those documents: 
•
Review first the Proof of Service of Summons, where you will find the date and time and in what
manner the Plaintiff’s “process server” declares they served you, either personally to you or by other
means.
•
If the Proof of Service of Summons states that you were served by posting and subsequent mailing,
the file must also have and you will also need to obtain a copy of another document called
□Application and Order to Serve Summons by Posting for Unlawful Detainer which has been
signed by a judge.
How You may Refute the Proof of Service of Summons:
•
Courts give a presumption of validity to a Proof of Service of Summons.
o You will need to convince the Court that you were not properly served in the manner set forth
in the Proofs of Service of Summons.
o To do so, you will need to refute the declaration of the person who has declared under
penalty of perjury that you were properly served.
•
Review the proof of service information: who the process server says they served, where, and on
what date and time. If they state they served you personally, is it true? Look at where, and what
date and time?
o To refute the Proof of Service of Summons, you may need some documentary proof that you
could not have been served as stated on the Proof of Service of Summons. Such evidence
EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR STAY FOR
EXECUTION OF JUDGMENT  
3
might be that you were at work or out of town on the date & time the process server claims 
they served you or you were not present at the location stated.  
o To prove it, you may need to include in your Ex Parte Application copies of your airplane
ticket, your workplace timesheet, or other receipts that can show where you were at the time
you were allegedly served the Summons and Complaint.
Preparing for your Ex Parte (Emergency) Court Date if no Answer was filed:
•
The Ex Parte Application
•
The Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment
•
Proposed Answer
•
Fee Waiver (Separate Packet - How To & Forms)
III.
When You Filed Your Answer, but Failed to “Appear” for Your Trial
Get copies of these following documents:
□Summons and Complaint—including its Exhibits (attached documents)
□Proof of Service of the Summons/Complaint – the filing that shows who served the lawsuit
against you and when, how, where etc.
□Notice of Trial – the letter that the court sends with your trial date on it.
□Case Summary –  the court index/summary of action or documents in the file Evictions are
considered “summary proceedings,” on an accelerated timeline.

The law requires the Court to calendar an eviction trial within 21 days of the date that either party
files the Request for Trial.

The Court then mails a “Notice of Trial” to both parties, and a copy of that Notice and the Court
Clerk’s Certificate of Mailing will be in the Court’s file.

The law also has a presumption that if something is mailed by regular mail, the addressee is
presumed to have received it. Therefore, you will have to overcome this presumption with evidence
that you did not receive it.
What you may need to do:
•
First check the court file
o
Where did the Court Clerk send the Notice of Trial?
o
Determine to whom and to what address the Court mailed the Notice of Trial.

If it was not mailed to you or to the address you put on your Answer, that may be
evidence that you did not receive it due to the Court’s own error.

You could include a copy of the Notice of Trial and the Court Clerk’s Certificate of
Mailing with your Ex Parte Application for Stay and your Motion to Set Aside the
Default.  You could indicate in your declaration that the Clerk sent the Notice of Trial to
the wrong address.
o
Was the Notice of Trial Returned to the Court?

Ask the Court Clerk to print a “Case Summary” or “Case History.”

If the Notice of Trial did not reach you because it was returned to the Court, this may
also evidence you did not receive it.
EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR STAY FOR
EXECUTION OF JUDGMENT


Request a photocopy of the Notice of Trial and the envelope in which it was returned
to the Court and include these photocopies with your Ex Parte Application for Stay and
your Motion to Set Aside the Default.
o
When the Notice of Trial was properly mailed and was not returned to the Court.

In these situations it is more difficult to overcome the presumption that you received the
Notice of Trial.

The Court will look to evidence that someone else had the ability to intercept your mail.
For example, if you do not have a secure mailbox, that may be evidence that someone
else took the mail.

You will need photographs of your mailbox, or the location to which your mail is
delivered to show the Court. Or any other evidence that shows why you would not get
the trial date notice in the mail
Preparing for your Ex Parte (Emergency) Court Date if an Answer was filed but you missed the 
Court date:
•
The Ex Parte Application
•
The Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment
What to Expect at the hearing:
You will be required to present a copy of all your documents to the landlord/landlord’s attorney at the Ex 
Parte Hearing.   You may want to speak with the landlord about any negations about your case.    The 
landlord is not required to negotiate with you at this stage, but may do so in order to come up with an 
agreement/settlement that makes sense before going in front of the Judge.  
The Landlord or its attorney will be present.   They will likely argue aggressively that the case is over and 
that you should not be allowed to “reopen” your case for a second chance.   You must refute/counter the 
claims clearly and concisely.   Just because you file these forms does not automatically entitle you to re-
open your case.     
The Outcomes to the hearing:
If you are successful at the Ex Parte Hearing, the court will likely accept your proposed Answer (if you did 
not file one already) that you filed and set a new trial date in which to return to have your day in court.   The 
Lock Out should be “stayed” or postponed until after the new trial date.   Be prepared to state your case at 
that new trial date with the necessary evidence, photos, testimony etc.  
Also, if you are successful, the Court will give you an Order to Quash or cancel the Sheriff lock out of your 
home.   You should not leave the Courtroom until you receive a signed Order from the Court cancelling the 
lock out to show the Sheriff just in case the Court cannot recall them in time.   The Sheriffs may already be 
on the way to your home.    
If the Judge does not grant your Motion, the Sheriff lock out will proceed as scheduled. Remember the 
Sherriff must serve a FIVE (5) Day Vacate Notice before they return to escort or “Lock” you out of your
home.   Remember that upon occasion, these notices are removed by the landlord’s agents, neighbors and 
other vandals to hamper your ability to know when your lock out is. 
EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR STAY FOR
EXECUTION OF JUDGMENT

If you are locked out, your landlord is required to keep your possessions in storage for you to pick up for a 
short period of time.   The landlord may charge you for the storage of these possessions, but if you do not 
pick up your things within the timeframe under the law, the landlord may keep, sell, or discard all of your 
possessions left in the home after the lock out.    Therefore, it is usually a good idea to transfer most of 
your valuables to storage or a friend/relative’s home for safekeeping. 
STEPS TO PREPARING & FILING YOUR EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR STAY OF
EXECUTION OF THE JUDGMENT
1. Choose a court date and time.  Write this information in your Stay papers where it says
to do so.  See the table below for the days and times different Courts allow you to see a
Judge for a Stay of Execution.   The times change constantly.   Make sure the
filing/hearing times are still valid/correct.
2. Give required prior telephone notice of the Court hearing date and time to the
opposing party.
You must call the Landlord/Plaintiff’s attorney by 10:00 a.m. the Court day before you file
your papers in Court. (You may give notice to the landlord directly only if he or she is not
represented by an attorney.)  For example, if you want to go to Court on Monday at 1:30 p.m.,
you must give prior notice the preceding Friday by 10:00 a.m. (You may give less notice only
if you have a good reason. When you give the notice you must state all of the following:

your name,

the case name and number,

the date and time you will go to Court,

the name and address of the court and the department or room number,

that you are asking the court for an “Ex Parte Application for a Stay of
Execution of the Judgment and an Order Shortening Time for Service and
Hearing on a Motion to Set Aside the Judgment.
On the next two pages you will find the forms 

“Unlawful Detainer Ex Parte Application Schedules and Locations” that gives
the locations, days and times to schedule your Ex Parte Application for Stay
EACH COURT HAS DIFFERENT HEARING & FILING TIMES and

“Ex-Parte Notice in an Unlawful Detainer Case” Script that you can use as a
guide on how to give proper Ex Parte notice.
If you unable to reach the person, you can leave a voicemail message for him/her or a 
message with someone else at that person’s home or office.  After giving notice, write down: 
the date and time you called, if you left a message and who you left a message with, and if 
you spoke to someone, his/her name and what he/she said to you. 
3. Prepare Your Ex Parte Application for Stay of Execution of the Judgment
Attached to this packet is a How-to Guide on how to fill out the required forms. Do not
fill in that guide. We have also given you blank versions of the forms for you to fill out.
4. Prepare a Motion to Set Aside the Judgment (A separate packet of forms).
This Motion asks the Court to “re-open” your case, but this Motion on its own may
take almost 3 weeks to be held in Court.   As most people only have a few days,
this “Ex-Parte” Application seeks an immediate hearing and requires a phone call to
the other side before 10 am the court day before the hearing.

EXECUTION OF JUDGMENT

4. Make 2 copies of all the Stay papers.  You will also need to fill out your Motion to
Set Aside Papers and follow the instructions in that packet.  If you did not file an ANSWER,
you will also need to a “proposed” answer to file with your papers.   Take all the originals you
filled out and copies to file at the Clerk’s office on the Court date for your Ex Parte Application
for Stay Hearing.
5. You may have to pay a filing fee, unless you qualify for a fee waiver. You
may also have to file an Answer to the Unlawful Detainer Complaint if you have
not already done so. Ask for that How To packet and Forms packet for the
Unlawful Detainer Answer.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
A court of general jurisdiction has a statutory as well as an inherent duty and power to 
control its own processes and orders so as to make them conform to justice, including the 
granting of a stay of execution.  Code of Civil Procedure Section states in pertinent part: “(a) 
Every Court shall have power: . . . (8) To amend and control its processes and orders so as to 
make them conform to law and justice.” CCP §128(a). This was confirmed in Revolution 
Eyewear, Inc. v. Aspex Eyewear, Inc. (2009), 2009 U.S. LEXIS 64749, wherein the court stated 
that “The district court has the inherent power to control and manage its docket, which includes 
the authority to order a stay pending the outcome of reexamination proceedings.” Id at 9. 
Here, the court has authority to grant a stay to enable Defendant(s) sufficient time to 
present and argue the underlying Motion to Set Aside the Default, Vacate the Judgment, and 
Recall the Writ of Execution.  If the stay is not granted, Defendant(s) will be locked out without 
an opportunity to present the motion.  As the attached Motion shows, Defendant should have the 
right to have this eviction case heard on its merits.  Therefore, the stay should be granted.

THE COURT MAY SET ASIDE A JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO CCP § 473(b)
WHEN ENTERED AGAINST A DEFENDANT DUE TO HIS/HER MISTAKE,
INADVERTENCE, SURPRISE OR EXCUSABLE NEGLECT
California's Code of Civil Procedure § 473(b) states:
The court may, upon any terms as may be just, relieve a party . . . from a 
judgment . . . taken against him or her through his or her mistake, 
inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.  Application for this relief . . . 
shall be made within a reasonable time, in no case exceeding six months. 
CCP § 473(b) is a remedial statute and should be liberally construed to carry out the 
policy of permitting trials on their merits.  See Faasuyi v. Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167

Cal.App.4th 681, 695 quoting McCormick v. Board of Supervisors (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d. 352 
(internal citations and quotations omitted).  Absent prejudice to the Plaintiff and diligence by the 
Defendant, only “very slight” evidence is needed to set aside a default.  Id.  The standard is if 
the act or omission is one that a reasonably prudent person would commit under the same 
circumstances.  See Transit Ads, Inc. v. Tanner Motor Livery, Ltd. (1969) 270 Cal.App.2d 275, 
279. Fraud by a third party, physical incapacity or death in the family can cause excusable
neglect.  See Shapiro v. Clark (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1128; see also Gamet v. Blanchard (2001) 
91 Cal.App.4th 1276 and Sullivan v. Sullivan (1967) 246 Cal.App.2d 301. 
II.
THE COURT MAY SET ASIDE A DEFAULT AND DEFAULT JUDGMENT
UNDER CCP § 473.5 WHEN PROPER SERVICE DOES NOT RESULT IN
ACTUAL NOTICE IN TIME TO DEFEND THE LAWSUIT
California Code of Civil Procedure § 473.5 states:
(a) When service of a summons has not resulted in actual notice to a party in time to
defend an action . . . [Defendant] may serve and file a notice of motion to set aside the
default . . . within a reasonable time, but in no event exceeding the earlier of:  (i) two
years after entry of a default judgment . . . (ii) 180 days after service on him or her of a
written notice that the default or default judgment has been entered.
(b) A notice of motion to set aside a default . . . shall be accompanied by an affidavit
showing . . . that the party's lack of actual notice . . . was not caused by his or her
avoidance of service or inexcusable neglect.
Cal. Civ. Proc. § 473.5.  The purpose of this law is to allow cases to be decided by trials on 
their merits.  Id.  The Defendant has not received “actual notice” unless he/she has personally 
received or personally viewed the Summons and Complaint by one of the service methods 
specified under Code of Civil Procedure sections 415.10 et. seq.  See Tunis v. Barrow (1986) 
184 Cal.App.3d 1069, 1077.

THE COURT MUST SET ASIDE A JUDGMENT PURSUANT TO CCP § 473(d)
AND THE COURT'S EQUITABLE POWERS UNDER CCP § § 128(a)(8) and
86(b)(3) WHEN IT IS VOID FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.
If legal papers are not served in strict compliance with Code of Civil Procedure sections
415.10 et. seq., a judgment is void as the Court lacks jurisdiction.  See Ellard v. Conway (2001) 
94 Cal.App.4th 540; see also Rochin v. Pat Johnson Manufacturing Co. (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 
1228, 1239.  One may file to set aside a judgment that appears void on its face by a review of the 
judgment roll at anytime.  See Cal. Civ. Proc. §§ 473(d), 128(a)(8), 86(b)(3); see also Hayashi v. 
Lorenz (1957) 42 Cal.2d 848, 851.  However, one must file to set aside a judgment within the 
two year limit specified under Cal. Civ. Proc. § 473.5 if the judgment appears valid on its face 
but is void for lack of jurisdiction.  Rogers v. Silverman (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1114, 1121-1122.  
IV.
THE COURT MAY SET ASIDE A JUDGMENT AT ANYTIME USING ITS
EQUITABLE POWERS UNDER CCP § § 128(a)(8), 86(b)(3) WHEN A 
JUDGMENT IS ENTERED BASED ON EXTRINSIC FRAUD AND/OR
MISTAKE, AND, IN LIMITED CIVIL CASES, INADVERTENCE AND/OR
EXCUSABLE NEGLECT
The Court has inherent equitable powers to set aside a judgment obtained by extrinsic
fraud and/or mistake to ensure its orders conform to justice.  See Cal. Civ. Proc. §§ 128(a)(8).  In 
limited civil cases, the Court may also consider inadvertence and excusable neglect.  See Cal. 
Civ. Proc. §§ 86(b)(3).  Such fraud and/or mistake includes most external circumstances 
depriving a party of a fair trial, such as the other party filing a false proof of service.  In re 
Marriage of Park (1980) 27 Cal.3d 337, 342; see also Sullivan, supra, 256 Cal.App.2d 304.   
In default cases, there is a 3-part test for relief; whether there is/was: 1) a meritorious 
case--do the facts, if proven, create a possible different result (not required if not required if 
improper or lack of service); 2) a valid reason for not defending the original case; and, 3) 
diligence (ordinary care in the situation) used in requesting to set aside the default once             
THIS SECTION EXPLAINS THE 
LEGAL AUTHORITY FOR THE 
JUDGE TO CONSIDER AND 
GRANT YOUR MOTION.

Cal.App.4th 1128, 1144; see also McCreadie v. Arques  (1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 39, 46.  The 
Court also considers any possible prejudice that could result from the set aside.  Munoz v. Lopez, 
(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 178, 183. 
V.
CONCLUSION
The Court should set aside the default and judgment and quash any writ of possession
and/or execution in the interest of due process and fairness.  Defendant should be able to 
properly defend the case and have it decided by a trial on its merits.

Breach of Warranty of Habitability
"Fair rental value" = monthly rent divided by 30 ("daily rent"). It may be too high, 
(i.e. for bad conditions in your unit). If it is, mark box 4(b).  Use the checklist on 
attachment 3w to list the bad conditions.  This falls under "Breach of Warranty of 
Habitability" and you will want to check the box below.  If the Warranty is 
breached, by law the rent is too high and the judge may reduce the rent owed.
You may check boxes 
5(c) and 5(d) if you 
want these orders if 
you win

□
The notice does not identify ____ an address or _____ telephone number _____ available days of the
week or _____ hours where the rent can be paid _____ or natural person for whom to pay. CCP§ 1161
□
Plaintiff served the notice before the rent was due or during the late fee period.
□

_____  the notice cannot expire on the same day it was served.  CCP §1161
_____ Plaintiff only accepts rent on certain days but counted days it was unavailable to accept rent.
□
