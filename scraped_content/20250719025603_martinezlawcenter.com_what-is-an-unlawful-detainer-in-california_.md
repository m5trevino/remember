What Should I Do If I’m Facing an Unlawful Detainer?
Here are some essential things every tenant should do:
Read paperwork carefully:
The unlawful detainer papers may have strict legal deadlines you must meet to avoid losing by default.
Seek legal assistance:
An unlawful detainer lawyer can help assert important defenses. If low-income, research legal aid resources.
File an Answer:
To dispute the eviction and have your day in court, you must “file an answer” with the court by the deadline.
Pay rent to court:
In nonpayment cases, tenants sometimes can “redeem” their tenancy by paying the landlord all rent owed. Get legal advice beforehand.
Assert rights and defenses:
California tenants have certain rights in unlawful detainer cases. An attorney can help formulate defenses and protect your interests. These defenses could potentially get your case dismissed.
Negotiate move-out deal:
If losing seems inevitable, your lawyer may be able to negotiate a settlement where you voluntarily move out by an agreed date in exchange for the unlawful detainer being dropped.
Bottom line – unlawful detainers can get extremely complicated. Getting experienced legal help maximizes your chances of preventing an unfair or illegal eviction. Don’t wait until sheriffs are banging down your door – act fast!
Important Questions and Answers About Unlawful Detainers
Can my landlord physically lock me out or remove my stuff?
No. “Self-help evictions” are illegal in California. This includes things like changing your locks, removing your personal property, turning off utilities, or using force or threats to make you leave. Only sheriff’s deputies can legally remove you once a court grants an eviction order.
What if I can’t afford a lawyer or legal fees?
Research low-cost legal aid resources in your county. Some nonprofits provide free or sliding-scale assistance to low-income tenants facing eviction lawsuits. Court self-help centers also have resources to help people representing themselves.
You can also request that court filing fees be waived if you are low-income. An unlawful detainer attorney can help with the paperwork. Some lawyers offer payment plans as well.
Should I stop paying rent once I get an eviction notice?
No. Withholding rent will likely backfire and only strengthen your landlord’s case against you. In a nonpayment unlawful detainer, you actually have the right to “redeem” your tenancy up until five days before trial by paying the landlord everything you owe.
What common defenses can I raise to fight the eviction?
Two defenses tenants often raise are:
“Improper service”
– Argue you were not properly served the termination notice or unlawful detainer paperwork. If true, the judge may dismiss the case.
“Landlord retaliation”
– Claim the landlord is evicting you only in retaliation for exercising a legal tenant right, like requesting repairs. Retaliation is illegal under California law.
Other common defenses depend on the specifics of your case. An experienced lawyer can assess defenses that apply to your situation.
What Happens After a Judgment Against Me?
If the court enters a judgment against you, the landlord will get a “Writ of Possession” allowing the sheriff’s department to forcibly evict you if you refuse to leave. Here is that process:
1. Sheriff Gives You 5-Day Notice to Vacate
After getting the writ, the landlord will schedule an eviction lockout with the sheriff’s office. The sheriff will then tape a 5-day “Notice to Vacate” to your door.
During this period, you should immediately begin moving out to avoid forcible removal later.
2. Sheriff Returns to Remove You After 5 Days
If you haven’t vacated in 5 days, sheriff’s deputies will return to physically lock you out. Any remaining property will likely be seized, removed, and possibly sold off. Forcible evictions also negatively affect your credit history and rental references.
3. Landlord Regains Possession
Once the sheriff removes you and your belongings, the landlord legally regains possession of their rental property. Make sure to provide the landlord a forwarding address where they can return your security deposit after accounting for any unpaid rent and damage claims they may deduct.
Don’t Wait – Take Action to Protect Your Rights
Getting hit with an unlawful detainer lawsuit can be stressful and frightening. While California eviction laws favor landlords, understanding your rights levels the playing field. Seeking legal counsel maximizes the chances of reaching a favorable outcome.
