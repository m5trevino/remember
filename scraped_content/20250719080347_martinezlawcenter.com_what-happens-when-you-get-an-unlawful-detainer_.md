What happens after you answer an unlawful detainer?
After a tenant files a written response, or “answer,” with the court, the following typically occurs:
The court will schedule a hearing, usually within 20 days of the summons being served.
At the hearing, both the landlord and tenant will present their evidence and arguments.
If the court rules in favor of the landlord, it will issue a judgment for possession of the property.
The landlord can then request a “writ of possession” from the court, allowing the sheriff to physically remove the tenant from the property.
The tenant may be ordered to pay the landlord’s attorney fees, court costs, unpaid rent, and rent for the time they remained in the property illegally.
What is the difference between an unlawful detainer and an eviction?
An “unlawful detainer” is the legal term for the court process that a landlord must follow to evict a tenant in California. The term “eviction” is often used interchangeably with “unlawful detainer,” as the end result is the same – the tenant is forced to vacate the rental property.
The key difference is that an unlawful detainer is the specific legal procedure that must be followed, whereas “eviction” is the broader term for the act of removing a tenant from a property.
What are the consequences of an unlawful detainer for a landlord?
For landlords, the consequences of an unlawful detainer can include:
Legal fees and court costs associated with the eviction process
Potential loss of rental income during the time it takes to remove the tenant and find a new one
Liability for engaging in illegal eviction tactics, such as changing locks or shutting off utilities
Damage to the landlord’s reputation and relationships with future tenants
Landlords must carefully follow the proper legal procedures to avoid these potential pitfalls and protect their rights.
