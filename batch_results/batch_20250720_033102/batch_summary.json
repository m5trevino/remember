LEGAL RESEARCH ANALYSIS PROMPT:  \"You are a California landlord-tenant legal expert. Your job is to mine sworn testimony for every legal advantage under California's Tenant Protection Act (TPA) in an unlawful detainer (eviction) proceeding. CASE FACTS:      Tenant (Matthew Trevino) has lived at the property 12+ months      His mother has lived there 10+ years      The home is a single-family dwelling built in 1944      The property is owned by an individual (not a corp or REIT)      Landlord failed to serve the mandatory TPA exemption notice      Landlord is attempting to claim the \u201csingle-family home\u201d exemption (Civ Code \u00a7 1946.2(e)(8)) without proper notice  OBJECTIVE:  Analyze and extract every legal doctrine, procedural rule, or evidentiary fact that supports the tenant\u2019s defense against eviction under the TPA.  Focus on attacking the landlord\u2019s attempted TPA exemption under CC \u00a7 1946.2(e)(8), and reinforce tenant protections under subsection (a) and related case law.
