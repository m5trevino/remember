    "content": "\nAB 1482 is California\u2019s statewide eviction and rental price cap law, introduced by Assemblymember Chiu and signed into law by Governor Newsom. It is estimated to \u201cextend tenant protections to roughly 4.9 million households that are not currently covered by local rent control policies\u201d. It takes effect January 1, 2020 (although some of its provisions grandfather rental rates from 2019).\nHow is it different than existing law?\nCalifornia cities have long been able to regulate rental housing prices (provided they allow landlords a fair rate of return). Likewise, they can impose substantive limitations on evictions (which reduce displacement and strengthen price protections).\nRent control ordinances proliferated in California through the early nineties \u2013 with some imposing strict vacancy controls that maintain registered rents even when the former tenant leaves. In 1995, California adopted the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which regulates rent control ordinances at the state level.\nCosta-Hawkins does this in two ways: (1) It deregulates certain kinds of dwelling units (like new construction and \u201cseparately alienable\u201d single family homes and condominiums), and (2) it prevents strict vacancy control by allowing a landlord to set the initial rental rate for any new tenancy. Costa-Hawkins expressly does not affect local eviction controls, and it is a statement of what local governments cannot do with price controls, rather than a statement of what they may or must do.\nCalifornia has also largely been silent on \u201cjust causes\u201d for eviction until AB 1482. State law governs the timelines for evictions. The Civil Code details time periods for notices of termination, and the unlawful detainer statutes describes the requirements to use the summary eviction proceedings. The Ellis Act, effective 1986, was the only substantive grounds for eviction that the state required cities to include in any eviction control ordinance.\nAB 1482 seeks to regulate both price levels and the substantive bases for eviction at the state level. It pays deference to existing rent and price controls at the local level, and it overlaps with Costa-Hawkins\u2019 existing exemptions, adding certain qualifications for the \u201cnew construction\u201d and \u201cseparately alienable\u201d exemptions.\nEviction Controls:\nOnce a tenant has continuously occupied the dwelling for 12 months, the landlord needs \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate the tenancy. (Adding another adult tenant will \u201creset\u201d the clock until at least one tenant has been there for 24 months.) \u201dJust causes\u201d are either fault-based or non-fault.\n(1) Fault Based:\n\n(A) Default in the payment of rent.\n(B) A breach of a material term of the lease (after written notice).\n(C) Nuisance.\n(D) Waste.\n(E) Refusal to enter a lease for an additional term of similar duration.\n(F) Criminal activity (committed at the premises, or committed anywhere if directed at the owner).\n(G) Assigning or subletting the premises in violation of the tenant\u2019s lease.\n(H) Refusal to allow access.\n(I) Using the premises for an unlawful purpose.\n(J) Failure of an employee, agent, or licensee to vacate after termination.\n(K) Failure to vacate after providing notice.\n\n(2) Non-Fault:\n\n(A) Occupancy for the owner or their spouse, domestic partner, children, grandchildren, parents, or grandparents.\n(B) Withdrawal of the residential real property from the rental market.\n(C) Compliance with an order issued by a court or administrative agency requiring the tenant to vacate.\n(D) Intent to demolish or to substantially remodel the residential real property.\n\nRelocation Payments:\nFor non-fault terminations, landlords must provide \u201crelocation assistance\u201d to tenants within 15 days of the service of the notice. The notice must inform tenants of their right to relocation assistance\nThe assistance is either a payment equal to one month\u2019s rent, or a written waiver of the last month\u2019s rent, and this applies regardless of the tenant\u2019s income. However, if the tenant fails to vacate, the landlord can recover the amount of the payment as unlawful detainer damages.\nExemptions from Eviction Controls:\n\nHotels and other transient occupancy units.\nCertain medical, religious or care facilities.\nSchool-owned dormitories.\nCertain owner-occupied housing, including:\n\nHousing where the tenant shares bathroom or kitchen facilities with owner, who principally resides at the premises.\nSingle-family residences, provided the owner odes not rent more than two bedrooms/ADUs.\nDuplexes, provided the owner resided there at the beginning of the tenancy and continues to do so.\n\n\n\u201cNew construction\u201d \u2013 defined as a tenancy with a certificate of occupancy issued within the last 15 years.\nSeparately alienable dwellings, provided that:\n\nThe owner is not a real estate trust, a corporation, or an LLC with a corporate member; and\nThe lease notifies the tenant of the exemption.\n\n\nThe housing is already regulated or deed-restricted as a below-market-rate unit.\nThe housing is already regulated by an existing, local \u201cjust cause for eviction\u201d ordinance in effect prior to AB 1482, or one that is adopted afterward, but is more protective than AB 1482.\n\nPrice Controls:\nAB 1482 provides for limitation on rent increases. This has been described as \u201canti-price-gouging\u201d rather than \u201crent control\u201d (perhaps because it allows for larger increases than the constitutional minimum). Labels aside, the price controls operate in a similar way.\nDuring any 12-month period, the landlord may not increase the \u201cgross rental rate\u201d by any more than the lower of:\n\n10 percent; or\n5 percent plus the percentage change in the cost of living (where \u201cpercentage change in the cost of living\u201d means the percentage change from April 1 of the prior year to April 1 of the current year in the regional Consumer Price Index for the region where the residential real property is located, as published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics).\n\nThese price controls apply to tenants in existing contracts, but do not apply when those tenants vacate. And, while tenants may continue to sublet if their leases allow it, they may not charge more to subtenants than they pay to the landlord.\nThe price controls in AB 1482 apply retroactively to the gross rental rate in effect on March 15, 2019, and in the event the rent has been increased in excess of these limitations by the effective date of AB 1482 (January 1, 2020), the rents will be reset to the maximum allowable rent as if it had been in effect in March 15, 2019 (however, the landlord would not be liable for any \u201crent overpayment\u201d during that period).\nExemptions from Price Controls:\n\nThe housing is already regulated or deed-restricted as a below-market-rate unit.\nDormitories for use by students of an institution of higher education.\nHousing subject to price controls through a local ordinance that is consistent with Costa-Hawkins\n\u201cNew construction\u201d \u2013 defined as a tenancy with a certificate of occupancy issued within the last 15 years.\nSeparately alienable dwellings, provided that,\n\nThe owner is not a real estate trust, a corporation, or an LLC with a corporate member; and\nThe lease notifies the tenant of the exemption.\n\nDuplexes, provided the owner resided there at the beginning of the tenancy and continues to do so.\n\nLease Terms and Notification Requirements:\nAB 1482 requires landlords to provide several notifications to the tenant as a condition of exercising their rights.\n\nLandlords of newly regulated tenancies, and landlords entering or renewing any tenancies after July of 2020 must provide this disclosure: \u201cCalifornia law limits the amount your rent can be increased. See Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code for more information. California law also provides that after all of the tenants have continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 12 months or more or at least one of the tenants has continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 24 months or more, a landlord must provide a statement of cause in any notice to terminate a tenancy. See Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code for more information.\u201c\nFor owners who wish to occupy their property or allow family to occupy, the lease must \u201callow the owner to terminate the lease if the owner, or their spouse, domestic partner, children, grandchildren, parents, or grandparents, unilaterally decides to occupy the residential real property\u201c. Leases entered after July 1, 2020 must include the language, but a landlord can add the language to any lease as one of the \u201csimilar terms\u201d in a lease renewal.\nFor owners of single family homes who are qualified for exemption, they must include the following disclosure: \u201cThis property is not subject to the rent limits imposed by Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code and is not subject to the just cause requirements of Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code. This property meets the requirements of Sections 1947.12 (d)(5) and 1946.2 (e)(8) of the Civil Code and the owner is not any of the following: (1) a real estate investment trust, as defined by Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code; (2) a corporation; or (3) a limited liability company in which at least one member is a corporation.\u201d This term may either be included in a new lease or added in a renewal.\nLandlords must provide notice of the tenant\u2019s right to relocation assistance along with any notice of termination of tenancy.\n\nProblem Areas:\nIt is common for uncertainty to follow new laws until people start applying them in real life and courts have the opportunity to interpret them. AB 1482 appears to be \u201cself-contained\u201d, where it clearly identifies those units and tenancies it applies to.\nHowever, it is situated within the context of decades of tension between state and local landlord-tenant law, which took for granted that state law was procedural, not substantive. Analysis of AB 1482 evictions may want to borrow from the law governing local eviction controls. However, in the case of owner/relative move-in evictions, AB 1482 does not define the required duration or state that they must be performed in \u201cgood faith\u201d, which would seem to invite subjective interpretations and wrongful eviction lawsuits.\nLikewise, \u201cwithdrawal from the rental market\u201d is another just cause under AB 1482, but unlike with the Ellis Act, with its clearly defined scope, timelines and intent requirements, AB 1482 provides no guidance on how to withdraw or what portions of a property must be withdrawn.\n\n",

Unfortunately, rates throughout the rental market continue to rise rapidly and wages have not come close to keeping up. With existing law, rent can still increase by hundreds of dollars, renters in single-family homes are excluded from tenant protections, and it is set to sunset in a few short years,\u201d said Assemblymember Kalra. \u201cWith renters making up roughly half of the state\u2019s population, California must take every step to help keep families from being displaced, keep workers near their jobs, and ensure no one is pushed into homelessness due to a substantial rent increase. I am honored to author AB 1157, the Affordable Rent Act, and grateful to be joined by a large coalition in support and coauthors who recognize existing law is not enough\u2014these are safeguards we must bolster.\u201d\u00a0In 2019, California passed the Tenant Protection Act which created rent gouging and eviction protections to tenants across the state. Over the years, the cost of rent has continued to increase, making it unaffordable for many working families. Parts of California that were once considered affordable for families to rent have seen some of the biggest rent increases. According to data sourced from the Zillow Rent Index observing 2020 to 2023, rent has increased nearly 40% in many cities since the pandemic. For instance, in Santa Maria, rent increased by 40.9%, in Bakersfield by 39.4%, in Fresno by 38%, and in Riverside by 37.5%.\u00a0\u00a0The Affordable Rent Act, AB 1157, is co-authored by Assemblymembers Mia Bonta (D-Oakland), Isaac Bryan (D-Los Angeles), Sade Elhawary (D-South Los Angeles), Robert Garcia (D-Rancho Cucamonga), Corey Jackson (D-Moreno Valley), Alex Lee (D-San Jos\u00e9), Tina McKinnor (D-Inglewood), and Liz Ortega (D-San Leandro) and Senator Smallwood-Cuevas (D-Los Angeles).

    "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- A cap on yearly rent increases throughout the state could soon be lowered from 10% to 5%.\"This bill was first signed into law in 2019 and ran into effect in 2020. And, although we thought at the time we felt that it would help the rental crisis, the reality is that with the cap at 10%, as we have seen over the last six years it has gotten worse for renters, so that is not good enough,\" said California Assemblymember Ash Kalra.Kalra's AB 1157 advanced out of the state Assembly's Housing Committee on Thursday. Now it's moving forward to the next committee.MORE: Refrigerators, stoves would be required for new leases of residences under proposed California bill\"People from Silicon Valley, Los Angeles are moving further inland to Bakersfield, Fresno, Stockton, Sacramento--and rent into those places have gone up as much as 60% to 70% in the last five years. We are seeing now what used to be just a Bay Area, Los Angeles problem is a statewide problem,\" said Assembly member Kalra.AB 1157 looks to protect tenants across the state.  Along with the 5% cap, the bill includes single-family home rentals and removes the 2030 sunset date of the original legislation, making it permanent. Small property owner groups say their members feel targeted.\"Really disappointed that this was able to be passed along. We believe that the voters have already spoken several times and most recently in this past election about provisions around statewide rent control. This is another attempt to throttle that and undo what was presented and approved on all sides back in 2019,\" said Derek Barnes, CEO of the East Bay Rental Housing Association.On Thursday, 160 property owners were in Sacramento to protest AB 1157.MORE: California voters reject Proposition 33, which sought to expand rent control\"The message they brought is that the bill hurts small property owners. It's harmful. It targets small property,\" said Charley Goss with the SF Apartment Association. \"The cost of operating rental housing in California are going up every year. Insurance is going up 30% every year. Our garbage rates are proposed to go up 30% over the next three years.\"These groups want the state to focus on building more housing and not pushing small properties out. Housing advocates say this change is needed to prevent more Californians from ending up homeless.\"I have clients who have received $500 increase, and it's not just one client. It's a building that receives that rent increase and many of those clients couldn't afford and had to move out of the city,\" said Ramon Bonifacio, tenant counselor at SOMCAN. \"We can't really protect our tenants if the law in the state is not helping them.\"Copyright \u00a9 2025 KGO-TV.

    "content": " What is AB 1482? \nRent Increase Cap. Commencing January 1, 2020, AB-1482 limits rent increases for buildings built over 15 years ago, to just 5 percent per year plus the local rate of inflation. The local rate of inflation is tied to the Consumer Price Index in each area. Currently, Los Angeles and Orange Counties\u2019 CPI is 3.3%.\nJust Cause Provision. In addition to placing a cap on annual rent increases, AB-1482 requires landlords and property managers to have \u201cjust cause\u201d before they can legally evict any tenant who has continuously resided in their apartment for 12 months.\u00a0 Overall, the \u201cjust cause\u201d provision was enacted to prevent tenants from being evicted without any reason.\nThe \u201cjust cause\u201d provision of AB 1482 is not applicable until a tenant has lived in the apartment continuously for 12 months. Additionally, if during the first 24 months of his or her tenancy, the tenant adds a \u201cnew\u201d adult to the lease agreement, the \u201cjust cause\u201d provision does not apply until:\n\neither one of the tenants has lived in the apartment for 24 months; or\nAll the tenants have been in the unit for at least 12 months.\n\nIn any event, as with the rest of the law, this provision only applies to cities that do not currently have local just cause laws. As such, this provision will not apply to Los Angeles, Santa Monica, and Glendale.\nCan Tenants Still be Evicted \u201cFor Cause\u201d?\nAB-1482 does not prevent landlords from evicting tenants \u201cfor cause,\u201d which include but are not limited to the following reasons:\n\nA breach of a material or substantial term of the lease\nNonpayment of rent\nNuisance Violations\nCommitting waste\nUnlawful or criminal activity\nRefusal to sign a written extension or renewal of the lease\nAssigning or subletting without the owner\u2019s consent\nRefusal to allow the Landlord to enter the unit\n\nDespite the foregoing, if the tenant has lived at the property for at least 12 months, landlords are required under AB 1482 to give the renters the opportunity to \u201ccure\u201d the lease violation(s).\nAdditionally, Landlords still have authority to evict tenants for the following reasons:\n\nThe landlord wants to move into the apartment, or they want to move their family in\nThe landlord is getting out of the real estate business.\nThe landlord plans to \u201csubstantially\u201d renovate or covert the apartments to condos.\n\nIf a landlord decides to covert his or her apartments to condos and/or make substantial renovations, the landlord is required to pay the tenant\u2019s relocation fees, which is equal to one month\u2019s rent.\nAre there any exemptions to AB 1482?\nAB 1482 will exempt buildings that were built within the last 15 years (i.e., building that received its certificate of occupancy, on or after January 1, 2005. Additionally, most condos and single-family homes are exempt from AB 1482. However, if the condo or home is owned by a corporation or a real estate investment trust (REIT), it is not exempt. Specifically, this provision of AB 1482 is critical for landlords who may have formed LLCs or other corporate entities to rent out their first or second homes. Duplexes are also exempt from AB 1482 if the owner occupies one of the units.\nAdditional Facts About AB 1482\nAn apartment can return to market rent once the apartment is vacated by the tenant.\nAB 1482 establishes a rolling date for compliance. As such, buildings that were built in 2008 will be subjected to AB 1482 starting in 2023, and so forth.\nAB 1482 has an automatic 10-year sunset in 2030. As such, if the legislature wants to extend the provision of AB 1482 beyond 2030, or they want to make AB 1482 permanent, they will have to vote to do that.\nSpecial Provisions for rent increases, which occurred between March 15, 2019, and January 1, 2020\nIf a landlord increased their tenant\u2019s rent by more than 5% plus the applicable CPI, between March 15, 2019, and January 1, 2020, the rent on January 1, 2020, must go back to what it was on March 15, 2019, plus 5% together with the applicable CPI.\nHowever, if a landlord increased their tenant\u2019s rent between March 15, 2019, and January 1, 2020, and the increase was less than 5% plus CPI, the landlord may increase the rent up to the statutorily permitted amount.\nNotice Requirements for AB 1482\nAs of July 1, 2020, landlords, who own properties that are exempt from AB 1482, must provide their tenants with written notice regarding the exemption.\nIf the tenancy existed prior to July 1, 2020, the notice could be included in the rental agreement, or it can be an addendum to the rental agreement, whatever form the landlord chooses, notice must be given by August 1, 2020.\nFor tenancies which commence on or after July 1, 2020, this notice must be provided either as an addendum to the lease or rental agreement or as a written notice signed by the tenant, with a copy provided to the tenant.\nWhat if a tenant believes that his or her landlord has violated AB 1482?\nCurrently, AB 1482 does not have formal reporting procedures or enforcement mechanisms. As such, tenants are urged to contact an attorney if they have reason to believe that their landlord has violated the law. Because of this it is important that landlords work with experiences Orange County and Los Angeles property manager to make sure that these laws are followed and the landlord is protected from any predatory actions.\nHire An Experienced Team\u00a0\nEven if you decide to be in control of your property management services, you still need to hire an experienced real estate team in your area.

In this comprehensive guide, we will analyze whether single-family homes are exempt from AB 1482, diving deep into the specifics of the law and its implications.\nUnderstanding AB 1482\nOverview of AB 1482\nAB 1482 was enacted to address concerns about rapidly increasing rents and tenant displacement across California. Key features of the legislation include:\n\nRent Control: Limits on annual rent increases, capping them at 5% of the current rent plus 2% of the local rate of inflation, or 10% of the current rent, whichever is lower.\nJust Cause Eviction: Requirements for landlords to provide a valid reason for terminating a tenancy after the first 12 months of occupancy.\n\nPurpose of AB 1482\nThe primary goals of AB 1482 are to:\n\nProtect Tenants: Provide stability by limiting the frequency and extent of rent increases.\nEnsure Fair Practices: Introduce regulations to prevent arbitrary evictions and ensure fair treatment of tenants.\n\nApplicability of AB 1482 to Single-Family Homes\nGeneral Applicability\nAB 1482 applies broadly to most residential rental properties in California, but there are specific exemptions. The applicability to single-family homes can be complex, as it depends on various factors:\n\nProperty Ownership: The law\u2019s applicability may differ based on whether the single-family home is owned by a large corporate entity or an individual landlord.\nProperty Type: The specific characteristics of the rental property can influence whether it falls under the protections provided by AB 1482.\n\nExemptions Under AB 1482\n1. Single-Family Homes Owned by Large Entities\nSingle-family homes that are owned by large corporate entities or REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are generally not exempt from AB 1482. These properties are subject to the rent control and eviction protections established by the law.\n2. Single-Family Homes Owned by Individuals\nSingle-family homes that are:\n\nOwner-Occupied: If the landlord lives in one of the units of the single-family home, it is exempt from AB 1482.\nCorporate Ownership: Properties owned by corporate entities or large investors are included under AB 1482\u2019s regulations, irrespective of the type of dwelling.\n\nDetailed Analysis of Exemptions\nOwner-Occupied Single-Family Homes\nIf a single-family home is:\n\nOwner-Occupied: When the property is occupied by the owner of the property, AB 1482 does not apply. This exemption is in place to prevent interference with the rental of properties where the landlord is also a resident.\n\nSingle-Family Homes Exempted by Local Laws\nSome local jurisdictions in California may have additional rules or exemptions that interact with AB 1482. It is important for property owners and tenants to be aware of both state and local regulations.\nLegal and Practical Implications\nFor Landlords\n\nCompliance Costs: Landlords must be aware of whether their property is exempt from AB 1482, especially if it is owned by a corporate entity.\nOperational Adjustments: Landlords owning multiple properties or those operating within corporate frameworks need to ensure compliance with rent control and eviction provisions.\n\nFor Tenants\n\nRent Stability: Tenants in single-family homes that fall under AB 1482 enjoy protection from significant rent increases and arbitrary evictions.\nLegal Recourse: Tenants in exempt properties may not benefit from the protections offered by AB 1482, making it essential to understand the specific terms of their lease agreements and local regulations.\n\nFuture Considerations and Trends\nEvolving Legislation\nAB 1482 is part of a broader trend towards increased tenant protection across the U.S. Future legislative changes may include:\n\nExpansion of Protections: Potential expansions to include more types of rental properties under rent control laws.\nAdjustments to Exemptions: Modifications to current exemptions or the introduction of new provisions affecting single-family homes.\n\nImpact on Housing Market\n\nMarket Dynamics: The application of AB 1482 to single-family homes may affect rental market dynamics, influencing both rental prices and property investment strategies.\nEconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions may drive further changes in rental regulations and tenant protections.\n\nConclusion\nThe question of whether single-family homes are exempt from AB 1482 depends on various factors including ownership structure and whether the property is owner-occupied. While AB 1482 broadly applies to most rental properties in California, specific exemptions exist, particularly for single-family homes owned by individuals who reside in the property. For properties owned by corporations or large investors, AB 1482\u2019s rent control and eviction protections are applicable.\n",

I have a tenant with a one-year lease ending on August 1, 2025, which will transition to a month-to-month tenancy. I need clarification on whether my property qualifies as \"separately alienable property\" under AB 1482, requiring an exemption notice to be sent to tenants. I missed including this notice in the lease agreement for 2024. The California Association of Apartment Owners (CAA) guidelines mention the requirement for separately alienable properties but don't specifically address duplexes. Is it too late to send the exemption notice now? Additionally, if disputes arise upon lease expiration, can I use information from the CAA to justify missing the notice? Also, where can I find official information from California State and Los Angeles County indicating whether duplexes require this notice?\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\tLawyer Answer\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you live in one unit of your duplex and rent out the other, your property may qualify for the exemption under AB 1482 as \u201cseparately alienable,\u201d meaning it can be sold independently from other units. Owner-occupied duplexes generally fall under this exemption, but to benefit from it, you must give the proper notice to the tenant. Since your property appears to meet the criteria, the notice is required to officially claim that exemption from rent caps and just cause eviction rules. Even though you didn\u2019t include the exemption notice in the original lease, it\u2019s not too late to provide it now. AB 1482 doesn\u2019t prevent you from asserting the exemption later, but failing to deliver the notice on time could affect your ability to rely on it during a dispute. It\u2019s wise to give the written notice immediately\u2014do it in writing, and keep documentation of when and how it was delivered. If a disagreement arises, you might be able to point to sources like the California Apartment Association for guidance, but courts will prioritize state law and formal notices over association materials. To get clear, official information, review the California Civil Code (Section 1946.2) and check local Los Angeles County tenant protection ordinances. These sources outline whether a duplex like yours qualifies and what procedures are required to lawfully exempt your unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\tJustia Ask A Lawyer is a forum for consumers to get free answers to basic legal questions.

    "title": "CAA-led housing coalition opposes bill to lower AB 1482 rent cap \u2022 California Apartment Association",
    "content": "\nA coalition of housing industry organizations, led by the California Apartment Association, is opposing new legislation that would impose permanent statewide rent control and expand eviction restrictions to nearly all types of rental housing in California.\u00a0\nAssemblyman Ash Kalra\nThe proposal, AB 1157, introduced March 28 by Assemblyman Ash Kalra, D-San Jose, seeks to amend the state\u2019s Tenant Protection Act, originally enacted as AB 1482. The bill would reduce the state\u2019s rent cap from 5% plus inflation, or 10%, whichever is lower, to 2% plus inflation, or 5%, whichever is lower.\u00a0\nIt would also eliminate a critical exemption for single-family homes and condominiums from statewide rent caps and just-cause eviction requirements. Under current law, these properties, if \u201calienable separate\u201d from other units, are exempt from statewide rent control and just-cause eviction protections. AB 1157 would remove that exemption, making nearly all residential properties subject to strict rent control and eviction regulations.\u00a0\n\nAt a glance\nWho\u2019s against the legislation\nOpposing coalition: California Apartment Association, Building Owners and Managers Association of California, California Association of Realtors, California Building Industry Association, California Business Properties Association, California Chamber of Commerce, California Mortgage Bankers Association, National Association of Industrial and Office Properties (NAIOP of California), and The Institute of Real Estate Management.\nWho\u2019s behind the legislation\nBill author and co-authors: Assembly Members Ash Kalra, D-San Jose; Mia Bonta, D-Oakland; Isaac Bryan, D-Los Angeles; Sade Elhawary, D-South Los Angeles; Robert Garcia, D-Rancho Cucamonga; Corey Jackson, D-Moreno Valley; Alex Lee, D-San Jos\u00e9; Tina McKinnor, D-Inglewood; Liz Ortega, D-San Leandro; and Senator Lola Smallwood-Cuevas, D-Los Angeles.\nBill sponsors: Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE), Housing Now! CA, PICO California, Public Advocates, and UNITE HERE Local 11.\n\nThe bill further proposes making the statewide rent and eviction controls permanent. These provisions, adopted in 2019, are currently scheduled to sunset on Jan. 1, 2030.\u00a0\nWhile tenant groups have pushed for tighter restrictions, CAA and other organizations argue that the measure would discourage investment in rental housing and make the state\u2019s housing crisis worse.\u00a0\nIn an opposition letter dated April 1, the coalition warned that AB 1157 could significantly harm California\u2019s rental housing market. They pointed out that nearly 40% of the state\u2019s rental housing stock consists of single-family homes, individually owned condominiums, and duplexes. Imposing rent control on these properties, the letter says, could push many owners to sell or withdraw their units from the rental market, further reducing the supply of available housing.\u00a0\nThe letter also argues that AB 1157 disregards the will of California voters, who have rejected rent control measures at the ballot box\u2014including Propositions 10, 21, and 33\u2014by wide margins.\u00a0\nAdditionally, the group noted that the bill lacks any income targeting, potentially providing rent breaks to high-income tenants, and fails to address the underlying issue of housing scarcity. The letter cites research from Stanford University and the California Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office showing that rent control reduces housing availability, discourages new construction, and worsens affordability over time.\u00a0\n\u201cPolicies like AB 1157 that penalize property owners while ignoring the core issue of housing scarcity will only worsen our problems. This fact has been demonstrated by decades of research and supported by the voters over and over again,\u201d the coalition stated in its opposition letter.\u00a0\nAB 1157 also authorizes tenants to seek damages if landlords violate rent caps and empowers the state attorney general, city attorneys, and county counsels to enforce compliance, increasing legal risks for housing providers.\u00a0\nCAA continues to advocate against legislation like AB 1157 that would undermine the rental housing industry and exacerbate California\u2019s housing shortage.\u00a0\n\n\n",

    "content": "\nThe California Apartment Association has successfully derailed legislation that sought to impose stricter statewide rent caps and broader eviction controls, halting the proposal for the rest of 2025.\nAssemblyman Ash Kalra\nLess than a week after advancing from the Assembly Housing Committee, the proposal by Assemblyman Ash Kalra, D-San Jose, was pulled from consideration and removed from today\u2019s Assembly Judiciary Committee agenda. The move stalls the bill\u2019s progress until at least 2026.\nThe bill, known as AB 1157, proposed sweeping changes to California\u2019s existing rent cap law, AB 1482, by reducing allowable rent increases to 2% plus inflation, removing exemptions for single-family homes and condominiums, and eliminating the law\u2019s 2030 sunset date.CAA, which testified against the bill during last week\u2019s housing committee hearing, welcomed the news that the measure would not advance this year. CAA has consistently warned that the legislation would worsen California\u2019s housing shortage by discouraging investment and new housing construction.\n\u201cThis outcome reflects the power of a coordinated effort between CAA\u2019s lobbying team and our members,\u201d said Tom Bannon, chief executive officer for the California Apartment Association. \u201cThousands of rental housing providers wrote letters to lawmakers, and more than 150 came to the Capitol to oppose this bill in person. Their voices, combined with strategic advocacy from our government affairs team, played a key role in halting this damaging legislation.\u201d\nDebra Carlton\nDuring the April 24 hearing, Debra Carlton, CAA\u2019s executive vice president of state public affairs, cited the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office in explaining how rent control policies restrict supply and exacerbate unaffordability. Carlton also noted a sharp decline in multifamily housing permits following the qualification of Proposition 33, a failed 2024 ballot measure seeking to expand rent control. Further, she reminded committee members that many owners of single-family rental homes are still recovering financially from the inability to collect rent during the COVID-19 pandemic.Additional concerns came from pro-housing groups, including California YIMBY and YIMBY Action, who warned that AB 1157 could unintentionally worsen the state\u2019s housing shortage. Critics noted that the bill would extend price controls to accessory dwelling units (ADUs), one of the few housing types to see consistent growth in recent years.Opposition to the proposal came from a broad coalition of rental property owners, many of whom traveled to Sacramento last week to voice their concerns. Opponents emphasized that expanding rent control to single-family homes and eliminating the sunset date for rent caps would place further strain on small rental housing providers and limit future housing production. They also pointed out that California voters have rejected similar rent control expansions at the ballot box three times in recent years.Although the proposal will not move forward this year, CAA remains vigilant and committed to opposing policies that undermine housing creation and property rights.\n\nVIDEO\n\n\n",

    "title": "Assembly Housing committee advances bill to impose rent control on all housing \u2022 California Apartment Association",
    "content": " While the outcome came as no surprise given the makeup of the Assembly Housing Committee, a bill proposing stricter statewide rent caps and broader eviction restrictions cleared its first legislative hurdle, despite strong opposition from property owners and the California Apartment Association.\u00a0 On Thursday, April 24, the committee voted 7-5 to advance AB 1157 by Assemblyman Ash Kalra, D-San Jose. The bill would rework AB 1482 by reducing California\u2019s rent cap from 5% plus inflation to 2% plus inflation, remove exemptions for single-family homes and condominiums, and make the state\u2019s rent and eviction controls permanent.\u00a0 Assemblyman Ash Kalra The California Apartment Association testified against the measure, warning it would stifle housing development and discourage investment in rental housing.\u00a0 Debra Carlton, CAA\u2019s executive vice president of state public affairs, opened her testimony by quoting the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office: \u201cRent control discourages new housing. It does not resolve supply [issues] and it exacerbates unaffordability.\u201d\u00a0 Carlton highlighted a sharp decline in multifamily housing permits \u2014 from 60,000 in 2023 to just 30,000 in 2024 \u2014 following the qualification of Proposition 33, a failed 2024 ballot measure intended to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act and authorize extreme rent control measures. \u201cUnfortunately, AB 1157 will fuel this fall,\u201d Carlton predicted, arguing the legislation would worsen the housing permit decline.\u00a0 She also criticized AB 1157 for breaking a legislative promise made in 2019 when the Legislature approved the rent cap law: AB 1482, or the California Tenant Protection Act.\u00a0 \u201cThe promise when 1482 was passed was that it would remain in effect for 10 years,\u201d Carlton said. \u201cThe intent was to give the Legislature time to promote housing construction. Obviously, this breaks that promise.\u201d\u00a0 Debra Carlton CAA\u2019s chief lobbyist reminded committee members that California voters have rejected stricter rent control measures three times at the ballot box. Referring to the single-family homeowners attending the hearing\u2014many from the Bay Area who would lose exemptions under the bill\u2014she warned that stricter rent caps would be unsustainable, especially since many received no rental income during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 Bill breaks earlier sunset promise, threatens housing production\u00a0 During the committee debate, assembly members acknowledged the severe housing affordability crisis but remained divided on whether AB 1157 provided an appropriate solution. The discussion centered on balancing immediate tenant stability against concerns that stricter rent caps could hinder housing production.\u00a0 Assemblywoman Lori D. Wilson, D-Suisun City, emphasized adding to the housing stock should be the priority\u00a0 \u201cThe best way to suppress prices is to increase supply,\u201d Wilson said.\u00a0 She voted \u201cno\u201d on the bill.\u00a0 Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, D-Oakland, who co-authored the original 2019 law, warned that AB 1157 could negatively impact housing production. While Wicks voted to advance the bill to its next committee, she called for extensive stakeholder engagement before enacting such a significant policy change\u00a0 \u201cIf I think that this impacts housing production, I\u2019m going to have a lot of concerns moving forward,\u201d Wicks said.\u00a0\u00a0 The debate revisited the 2019 compromise that established the current rent cap law, AB 1482. Opponents questioned amending the law before its 2030 sunset without comprehensive data demonstrating its effectiveness. Assemblyman Joe Patterson, R-Rocklin, echoed the concerns, repeatedly noting voters\u2019 consistent rejection of tighter rent controls. Discussions also highlighted divergent views on the impact to small \u201cmom-and-pop\u201d landlords. Opponents stressed threats to their financial stability, while supporters claimed the bill would ensure reasonable returns for landlords and clarity for tenants.\u00a0 Property owners pack Capitol hearing to voice concerns\u00a0 Earlier that morning, about 150 opponents of AB 1157, organized by the San Francisco Apartment Association, filled Capitol halls wearing bright red shirts emblazoned with \u201cDon\u2019t Kill Housing! Stop AB 1157.\u201d Many attendees had traveled from San Francisco, lining up early to enter the hearing.\u00a0\u00a0 Photo by Mike Nemeth\u00a0Opponents of AB 1157, many from San Francisco\u2019s Chinese community, line the halls of the state Capitol in red shirts reading \u201cDon\u2019t Kill Housing! Stop AB 1157\u201d ahead of a legislative hearing on the bill. The California Apartment Association and the San Francisco Apartment Association helped organize the turnout.\u00a0 Among them was Tina Wong, co-founder of BetterHousingPolicies.org, who explained her organization\u2019s role in educating small Chinese property owners, who often face language barriers and lack awareness of state housing laws. Wong noted many property owners become upset upon learning of AB 1157\u2019s provisions.\u00a0 Wong expressed particular concern about applying rent control to single-family homes and condominiums and eliminating the 2030 sunset clause. She noted these expansions were precisely what opponents feared during debates over AB 1482 in 2019. She also worried the measure would increase litigation, benefiting lawyers at the expense of taxpayers and housing providers.\u00a0 Steed Ahn, president of the Chinese Real Estate Association of America, emphasized how rising costs affect small landlords, particularly first-generation immigrants striving to build generational wealth.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEverything is rising\u2014inflation, cost of living, gas prices, taxes \u2014 especially in California,\u201d he said. Ahn warned restricting rent increases would deter investment, reduce housing supply, and ultimately drive rents higher, calling it \u201cjust supply and demand, basic economics.\u201d\u00a0 Kimberly Wong, a Realtor who attended the hearing to represent family members who own rentals, voiced concern that most people are unaware of AB 1157\u2019s implications. \u201cIt\u2019s restricting property rights,\u201d she said, suggesting people would be shocked if they fully understood its potential impact. Moreover, she expressed frustration that the bill represents another step in an escalating pattern of regulation and costs burdening property owners, especially in the Bay Area.\u00a0 This was the first hearing on AB 1157.\u00a0 It still has a long way to go.\u00a0 AB 1157 now heads to the Assembly Judiciary Committee, where a hearing is set for Tuesday morning. CAA and a broad coalition of housing groups have vowed to continue opposing the legislation.

    "title": "Statewide rent control bill, AB 1482, narrowly passes off Assembly floor",
    "content": "\nDespite strong opposition from the California Apartment Association, the California Chamber of Commerce and others,\u00a0a statewide rent control bill on Wednesday night passed off the state Assembly floor.\nCAA remains steadfastly opposed to the bill, AB 1482 by Assemblyman David Chiu, D-San Francisco. The legislation now awaits committee hearings in the Senate.\nEarly Wednesday evening, AB 1482 appeared to be defeated for the year, being 7-8 votes short of the 41 votes needed for passage. Chiu, however, agreed to several amendments to his proposal, which led the California Association of Realtors to lift its opposition and take a neutral position to the legislation.\nChiu was then able to secure the needed votes to advance his proposal, which passed with 43 yes votes, 31 no votes and six abstentions.\nAssemlyman David Chiu\nIn recent weeks, CAA has spearheaded a grassroots campaign to stop AB 1482. Those efforts culminated Wednesday during the association\u2019s Legislative Conference in Sacramento, during which more than 400 rental housing owners and managers walked to the Capitol to ask lawmakers to reject the rent control proposal. CAA has also mobilized members to call Assembly members in their districts and urge no votes on the bill.\nSome highlights of the \u00a0amendments that Chiu has agreed to take relative to AB 1482:\nIncreasing the annual cap on rent increases from CPI plus 5% to CPI plus 7%, the same cap adopted by Oregon earlier this year.Exempting owners with 10 or fewer single-family homes.Sunsetting the bill in three years, but with the option to renew \u2013 a foregone conclusion.\n\u200bThese changes do not remove CAA\u2019s objections to the legislation.\u00a0Despite requests by CAA, Chiu has refused to provide any assurances that future Legislatures won\u2019t lower the annual cap on rent increases. The Legislature could conceivably lower the law from CPI plus 7 to CPI plus 1 next year. This creates instability in the marketplace.\u00a0\nAdditionally, including all buildings that are 10 years of age or older in the rent cap would result in a significant reduction, if not elimination, of new rental housing development projects. It is anticipated that with only a 10-year horizon, investors and lenders will opt to place capital in other ventures.\nMoreover, the bill still does not address the crux of California\u2019s housing crisis, which is a housing shortfall. California needs to build more housing as quickly as possible, and a statewide rent cap creates a disincentive for investors to build new housing or to renovate existing housing.\nAB 1482 does not include means testing, so the state\u2019s wealthiest residents will be eligible for a price ceiling on rentals, while renters\u00a0most\u00a0in\u00a0need will get no assurances of assistance.\n\u201cIt defies\u00a0logic that the state Legislature continues to advance rent cap legislation, which will worsen California\u2019s housing shortage, while rejecting legislation that would actually promote new homes, like SB 50, which\u00a0would prohibit bans on apartment construction near jobs centers and public transportation,\u201d said Tom Bannon, CAA\u2019s chief executive officer. \u201cThis push for statewide rent control also comes just months after voters resoundingly rejected Proposition 10, the statewide rent control measure on November\u2019s ballot.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time we work together to advance policies that will add housing that working families can afford instead of blanket policies that don\u2019t address the real problem \u2014 a lack of supply.\u201d\n\n",

    "title": "UC Berkeley's Terner Center suggests widespread landlord violations of state rent cap \u2022 California Apartment Association",
    "content": "\nThe UC Berkeley Terner Center for Housing Innovation has recently published an unsubstantiated report alleging that landlords throughout California may be violating a state law that limits rent increases.\nThe Terner Center report, \u201cRising Rents, Not Enough Data \u2014 How a lack of Transparency Threatens to Undermine California\u2019s Rent Cap,\u201d suggests there may be pervasive violations of the rent restrictions \u2014 generally 5% plus CPI \u2014 included in the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (Assembly Bill 1482).\nThe California Apartment Association denounced the report and its conclusions, which stem from irrelevant data and appear politically motivated. Surely radical tenant groups and some elected leaders will seize upon the report in their quest to further overregulate the rental housing industry with everything from stronger rent control laws to rental registries.\nFortunately, a counter report recently released by UC Riverside\u2019s Center for Economic Forecasting and Development contends the Terner Center report is badly flawed.\nThe response takes issue with the Terner Center\u2019s reliance on asking rents for vacant units listed on Zillow in suggesting possible widespread violations of AB 1482.\nAlthough AB 1482 caps rent increases on much of California\u2019s housing stock, vacant units \u2014 like those advertised on Zillow \u2014 are exempt from the cap, as are most privately owned single-family homes and new housing.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is a non sequitur,\u201d says the UC Riverside response, written by economist Christopher Thornberg, director of the Center for Economic Forecasting at UC Riverside. \u201cAs noted, the data in question is for units that are being advertised as available for rent and, as such, the caps imposed by AB 1482 do not apply.\u201d\nThe response goes on to say, \u201cSadly, the Terner Center\u2019s report represents a step backwards in discussing this critical and complex issue, seemingly designed more for stoking political outrage than for helping to guide California towards better solutions.\u201d\n\n\n",

    "title": "U.S. Supreme Court passes on rent control challenge; CAA to fight on \u2022 California Apartment Association",
    "content": "\nThe U.S. Supreme Court this month declined to hear appeals of two cases challenging the constitutionality of rent control and eviction restrictions, cases that had garnered support from the California Apartment Association through amicus briefs.\nIn the first case, 74 Pinehurst, LLC v. New York, the plaintiffs challenged New York\u2019s complex rent control and eviction regulation scheme, arguing that it effectively converted private property into public housing. The case had been closely watched ever since the court declined to hear the appeal of its companion case last autumn. \u00a0The court has kept property owners in suspense as it considered the case at 12 conferences before today\u2019s announcement not to hear the appeal.\nIn an uncommon move, Justice Clarence Thomas issued a written statement with the 74 Pinehurst denial indicating that while \u201c[t]he constitutionality of regimes like New York City\u2019s is an important and pressing question,\u201d he did not think the specific allegations in the underlying case were sufficiently developed to present an appropriate case to decide the issue. Justice Thomas\u2019 acknowledgment hints at a willingness to explore such constitutional questions in future cases, offering a small silver lining to the day\u2019s otherwise disappointing news.\nOn the other hand, the court gave no indication of its reasons for rejecting the appeal in El Papel v. City of Seattle. That case challenged the eviction moratoria imposed in Seattle and the State of Washington. In stark contrast to the 74 Pinehurst matter, and as is more common, the El Papel case\u2019s fate was decided at the first conference where it was considered.\n\u201cOf course, it is disappointing that the court has declined to hear these two cases, but I take some solace in Justice Thomas\u2019 acknowledgment that strict rent control and eviction regimes do in fact pose a constitutional question that is of interest to the court.\u201d said Whitney Prout, CAA\u2019s executive vice president of legal affairs. \u201cNow it\u2019s up to us to make sure the right case makes it way to the justices.\u201d\nThe court\u2019s rejection of these cases upholds the status quo, allowing state and local governments to retain broad constitutional authority to enact and enforce rent and eviction control laws. This outcome underscores the importance of defending existing safeguards, outside the Constitution, for rental housing providers. These protections include the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, a California law that exempts newly constructed apartments, single-family homes, and condominiums from local rent control and ensures that for regulated units rents can still be reset to market upon turnover \u2013 as well as the Ellis Act, and court precedent that limits local governments\u2019 ability to interfere in the eviction process. These protections have all come under attack in recent years, with CAA leading efforts in the Legislature and at city hall, at the ballot box, and in the court to protect rental housing providers.\n\n",

    "content": "Gov. Gavin Newsom. (Kevin Sanders for California Globe)\n\u00a0\nThe California Legislature passed and Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed into law Assembly Bill 1482 to impose statewide rent control by capping rent increases. Assembly Bill 1482 by Assemblyman David Chiu (D-San Francisco), prohibits California landlords from raising rent by more than 7 percent plus inflation over the course of a year.\nAssemblyman David Chiu. (Kevin Sanders for California Globe)\nAlmost simultaneously in July, the City Council of Long Beach passed the \u201cTenant Relocation Assistance Ordinance,\u201d which requires a property owner to pay to a tenant the equivalent of two months\u2019 rent for a unit of similar size in the City (up to $4,500) for any reason the owner needs to repossess the rental property.\nAB 1482 also requires (among other things) that an Owner pay a tenant one month\u2019s rent \u2013 characterized by the law as \u201crelocation assistance,\u201d the lawsuit says.\nNamed as defendants in the federal lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, are California Governor Gavin Newsom, and the City of Long Beach. The lawsuit, filed by attorney Paul Beard of Alston & Bird, names Better Housing for Long Beach and Joani Weir as plaintiffs.\nRent Control in California\nCalifornia voters soundly defeated a ballot measure less than one year ago in November 2018 that would have allowed for rent control in every city across the vast state.\u00a0 Proposition 10\u00a0would have repealed the\u00a0Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, which limits the use of rent control in California, but voters defeated it.\nHowever, rent control advocates vowed to soldier forward, and Gov. Gavin Newsom\u00a0announced that he had plans to make a deal on new rent control policies when he took office, the Globe reported. \u201cWe need new rules to stabilize neighborhoods and prevent evictions, without putting small landlords out of business,\u201d Newsom said during his State of the State address. \u201cI want the best ideas from everyone in this chamber. Here is my promise to you, get me a good package on rent stability this year and I will sign it.\u201d\nAnd he did sign it.\n\u2018Takings Clause\u2019\nIn a Globe interview, Attorney Beard said the new Long Beach ordinance mostly harms \u201cmom and pop\u201d landlords who may own one or a few small rental units. Plaintiff Joani Weir is the founder and President of Better Housing, and said she owns two four-plexes.\nBeard said the payout to renters is not tied to relocation costs, and puts no requirements that the money be used for rent. \u201cThe Long Beach ordinance was enacted to placate powerful interest groups,\u201d Beard said. \u201cThis is a naked \u2018taking\u2019 of property from one person to the other.\u201d\nThe Long Beach payment standards are as follows: studio\u2014$2,706; one bedroom\u2014$3,325; two bedrooms\u2014$4,185; three or more bedrooms\u2014$4,500.\nLong Beach Mayor Robert Garcia. (City of Long Beach)\nBeard said the Long Beach ordinance is a violation of (a) the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as incorporated against state and local governments by the Fourteenth Amendment, and (b) the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThe state law, AB 1482, \u201cimposes requirements on Owners intended to make it more difficult for them to exercise their right to repossess their properties, and to penalize them when they do,\u201d the lawsuit says. AB 1482 imposes a cap on rent increases, but there is nothing in the bill to prevent the 7 percent rent cap from being lowered in the future to 5 percent, then 3 percent.\nBeard noted that New York City, San Francisco, and Santa Monica \u2013 all cities with rent control ordinances \u2013 also have the highest rents in the nation. \u201cThis has displaced much of the minority community,\u201d Beard said. \u201cRent control pushes them out much quicker.\u201d\nRent Control Lawsuit\nAttorney Beard said under the U.S. Supreme Court, these cases apply here. \u201cThe Court has consistently said the Constitution does not allow the government to take from one individual and give to the other.\u201d\nBeard said the payment mandated by AB 1482 must be made regardless of the fact that an existing lease or rental agreement may not contemplate or allow it. It must be made \u201cregardless of the tenant\u2019s income\u201d or ability to afford relocation costs. \u201cFurther, the relocation-payment amount set by AB 1482 is arbitrary, as it is not tied to the costs of relocation. Finally, the tenant need not use the payment for relocation expenses. The tenant may use the payment for any purpose whatsoever.\u201d\nAn Owner\u2019s \u201cfailure to strictly comply\u201d with the relocation-payment mandate \u201crender[s] the notice of termination void.\u201d In other words, an Owner may not repossess his/her property unless and until the Owner fully complies with the relocation-payment mandate.\nJoani Weir said that in Long Beach, the goal is to take control of personal private properties where the government will treat it like a utility and control your assets. The owner may still technically \u201cown\u201d it, but it will be so heavily regulated, the owner can do nothing to it without permission from the government.\nBeard said \u201cUnconstitutional takings\u201d commonly arise in the context of the government attempting to take land or other real-property interests. But that is not the extent of the Takings Clause\u2019s reach. When \u201cthe demand for money . . . operate[s] upon . . . an identified property interest by directing the owner of a particular piece of property to make a monetary payment,\u201d the Takings Clause applies.\n\u201cThis clearly is an unlawful transfer of money from the landlord to tenants,\u201d Beard said.\nHe said the U.S. Supreme Court has been consistent in their rulings upholding the takings clause. \u201cAB 1482 also violates the Just Compensation Clause of the Takings Clause, because it contains no provision for compensating or otherwise mitigating the impacts to Owners of the forced relocation payments.\u201d\n\u201cThe relocation-payment condition under AB 1482 is unconstitutional under the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine, as applied in Nollan, Dolan, and Koontz in the context of the Takings Clause,\u201d and with no conceivable legitimate state purpose.\nThe Globe will follow this case closely and report any updates.\nBHLB Complaint\n\n",

    "content": "\nThe California Legislature deals with thousands of bills every year, and many are perennials that reflect long-running economic, ethnic and cultural conflicts.\nWarring interests try to gain the upper hand vis-\u00e0-vis their rivals. Regardless of the outcomes in any one legislative session, inevitably they clash again while augmenting their lobbying with efforts to bend public opinion and influence legislative elections.\nExamples of the syndrome abound. There\u2019s the perpetual jousting between personal injury attorneys and insurers over rules governing lawsuits, efforts by medical care providers to expand the scope of their practices while invading the turf of other practitioners, and the running battle between tribal casinos and cardrooms over gambling games.\nFor the last three decades, California\u2019s public education establishment \u2014 school boards and school unions, primarily \u2014 has waged political war against charter schools.\nCharters are public schools but are exempt from many of the rules governing conventional schools. They enroll about 11% of California\u2019s nearly 6 million public school kids, ranging from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade, and receive shares of the more than $100 billion that the state spends on public education each year.\nCharter advocates say they respond to parents dissatisfied with the educations their children receive in traditional schools. Their critics say they enroll a narrow slice of the student pool and divert money better spent on improving traditional education.\nThe battles over charter schools are often waged at the local level, because charters must be sanctioned by local school boards. An epic war has been underway for years in Los Angeles Unified, the nation\u2019s second largest school system. It ebbs and flows, depending on whether unions or charter advocates control the school board after each election cycle.\nThe public education establishment, particularly its unions, is very influential in the Capitol and has pursued a steady stream of bills that make forming charters more difficult or attempt to impose restrictions on those already operating.\n \n\n\n\n\nCalifornians have a lot to say\nCalifornians have a lot to say\n\n\nThere are plenty of commentators in the Capitol and on TV \u2014 we prefer fresh perspectives from different voices across our state.

If you want to hear from them, share your email.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year\u2019s version is Assembly Bill 84, which has cleared the Assembly and is now pending in the Senate.\nBacked by school boards and school unions, the measure purports to deal with scandals in charters that don\u2019t offer classroom instruction but rather operate via the internet or other means.\nThose scandals are real. The most notorious involved A3 Education, which had a network of 19 online charter schools. An investigation by the San Diego County district attorney\u2019s office revealed that the system\u2019s founders fraudulently obtained hundreds of millions of dollars. They were prosecuted and more than $200 million in purloined funds was recovered.\nIn response to A3 Education and other scandals, the state declared a moratorium on new non-classroom charters and commissioned a study to determine which reforms are needed to guard against fraud.\n\n\n\nRead Next\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAB 84 embraces many of the recommendations emerging from the study by the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office and the state\u2019s Fiscal Crisis & Management Assistance Team. But the bill goes further, with new accounting and operational processes that could make it more difficult for all kinds of charters to be formed or to function.\nOne provision \u2014 ignored in the analyses of the bill presented to legislators \u2014 would create an entirely new position of inspector general with very broad powers, housed in the state Department of Education, but appointed by the governor.\nThe co-authors of SB 84, Democratic Assemblymen Al Muratsuchi and Robert Garcia, contend that it\u2019s needed to prevent future scandals such as A3 and allow the moratorium on non-classroom charters to be lifted.\nThat\u2019s valid as far as it goes. But it also would provide new tools that the education establishment could use to thwart new charters and make life more difficult for existing charters by imposing rules that mirror those for traditional schools.\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nJanuary 27, 2025January 26, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nApril 25, 2024April 24, 2024 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSafeguard independent news for California\u2019s future\nFor 10 years, CalMatters has informed millions of Californians and kept our government and special interests in check.\n\nWe report what\u2019s happening.\nWe ask the hard questions.\nWe make our government transparent to Californians.\n\nRight now, every donation is matched dollar-for-dollar.

    "title": "California wants to lower housing costs by freezing building code - CalMatters",
    "content": "\n\n\nIn summary\nCalifornia lawmakers are considering a bill that would pause updates to state housing standards. Is the building code to blame for California\u2019s housing crisis? \n\n\nAs lawmakers scramble to turbocharge post-fire recovery efforts in Los Angeles and to tackle a housing shortage across the state, a new addition may be coming to California\u2019s building code: A pause button.\nAssembly Bill 306 would freeze the building standards \u2014 the rules governing the architecture, the layout, the electrical wiring, the plumbing, the energy use and the fire and earthquake safety features \u2014 for all new housing through at least 2031. Local governments, which often tack on their own requirements, would also be kept from doing so in most cases.\u00a0\nBuilding standards tend to reflect the state\u2019s most pressing concerns. New seismic requirements are added after major earthquakes, home-hardening requirements have followed deadly fires and new green energy mandates have popped up as California has raced to prepare for a warmer planet.\nThis latest proposed change to the code is meant to tackle another crisis: affordability.\nThe bill wouldn\u2019t delete any of the current rules, which are widely considered to be among the most stringent of any state\u2019s. It would also include exceptions, most notably for emergency health and safety updates. But on the whole, the California building code would be set on cruise control for the better half of a decade.\nAssemblymember Nick Schultz, a freshman Democrat from Burbank and the lead author of the bill, said there\u2019s nothing extreme about leaving the code as it is for a few years, particularly as homeowners in Altadena and the Palisades rebuild.\u00a0\nThough Schultz introduced the bill, the second listed co-author may explain why such a significant policy change swept through the Assembly with little resistance: Speaker Robert Rivas. In early April the bill passed out of the Assembly with 71 \u201cyes\u201d votes. No lawmakers voted against it. Now it heads to the state Senate.\nSuch smooth legislative sailing notwithstanding, plenty of environmental advocates, renewable energy industry groups, construction unions, structural engineers and code enforcement officials have turned out to oppose the bill. They see it as a radical upending of the way the state regulates buildings, reduces emissions and prepares for a changed climate.\n \n\n\n\n\nJust the right amount of news\nJust the right amount of news\n\n\nGet California\u2019s most essential headlines without feeling overwhelmed.\nGet California\u2019s most essential headlines without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding standards need to be nimble because the effects of climate change are unpredictable, said Laura Walsh, policy manager with Save the Bay, a nonprofit focused on conservation and preparing for rising seas. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to a place in the trend where things get worse really fast,\u201d she said.\nBeyond the specifics of the debate, the bill represents something fairly new in the politics of California housing.\u00a0\nOver the last decade, lawmakers in Sacramento have passed a raft of bills aimed at making it easier to build new homes. Most of those bills have set their sights on the zoning code \u2014 the patchwork of land-use standards that dictate which types of buildings can go where. If you recall any high-profile political battles about apartment buildings in exclusive suburbs, dense residential development near transit stops or proposed mountain lion sanctuaries \u2014 that\u2019s all about zoning.\nNow some lawmakers are considering a new deregulatory target. Schultz\u2019s freeze is the most dramatic example of a handful of bills this year that would take on the impenetrably technical, frequently overlooked and ever-changing building code \u2014 all for the cause of cheaper housing.\u00a0\nAs California legislators are \u201cfinding religion on land use, other issues are sort of bubbling up,\u201d said Stephen Smith, founder of the Center for Building in North America, a nonprofit that advocates for changes to building codes that make it easier to build apartment buildings. \u201cArchitects, developers, contractors are pointing out, \u2018No, actually, there are barriers in the actual construction process and many of those do go back to the building code.\u2019\u201d\nWhere does the building code come from?\nCalifornia\u2019s building code does not originate in California.\u00a0\nAs with most states, our code takes as its jumping off point a set of general rules written by the International Code Council, a nonprofit organization governed by a mix of building industry associations, state and local regulators, engineers and architects. Despite the name, the organization is based in Washington D.C. and its model codes are a predominantly North American product.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like naming the World Series the World Series,\u201d said Eduardo Mendoza, a research associate with California YIMBY, an organization that promotes more housing development.\nThe Code Council puts out its model codes every three years. The state then gets to work on its own version in a year-long process involving seven state departments.\u00a0\nFramers work to build the Ruby Street apartments in Castro Valley on Feb. 6, 2024. Photo by Camille Cohen for CalMatters\nThese exceedingly arcane deliberations typically receive little attention from the public. The exception is a small cadre of engineers, developers, architects, appliance manufacturers, energy efficiency, solar and climate advocates and other parties with a direct financial or ideological interest in the way new things get built.\u00a0\nFor these groups, the triannual code adoption cycle \u2014 and the \u201cintervening\u201d amendment process for urgent updates \u2014 make for an endless game of regulatory tug-of-war.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very bureaucratic, very dry, but still extremely political,\u201d said Mendoza.\nNow that behind-the-scenes fight is playing out in public.\u00a0\nOn one side are housing developers. Keeping up with the salvo of state and local building code changes is its own full-time job, said Dan Dunmoyer, president of the California Building Industry Association, a trade group for big builders.\u00a0\n\u201cWe had the most seismically safe, water-reduced, fire retardant, energy efficient homes in the world two years ago and we just keep on adding more and more and more to it,\u201d he said. \u201cAt what point do you just take a pause?\u201d\nA potential pause is especially appealing to many affordable housing developers, who typically rely on multiple sources of funding, all with their own restrictions and timelines. If a change in the building code means going back to the architectural drawing board and delaying a permit application, that can put off a potential project \u201canother year or two,\u201d said Laura Archuleta, president of Jamboree Housing Corporation, a nonprofit low-income housing developer in Irvine.\nCalifornia would not be the first state to consider tapping the brakes on its building code. In 2023, legislators in North Carolina passed a law banning most changes through 2031. That bill, backed by that state\u2019s building industry association, froze in place a significantly older code than California\u2019s; some of North Carolina\u2019s energy efficiency rules hadn\u2019t been changed since 2009.\nCalifornia\u2019s so-called 2025 code is set to go into effect in January 2026. That change will be grandfathered in, even if Schultz\u2019s measure passes. No additional changes would allowed until June 1, 2031.\nThe experts who help write the state\u2019s building standards have \u201chealth and safety and other criteria in mind but they don\u2019t have cost as a factor in their decision making \u2014 well, they should,\u201d said Assemblymember Chris Ward, a San Diego Democrat who voted for Schultz\u2019s bill. He is also the author of two other building code related bills this year. One would require the state to consider subjecting small apartment buildings to a more relaxed set of standards. The other would reevaluate whether builder should have more flexibility in meeting the state\u2019s energy efficiency rules.\nWard said that mining the building code for possible cost savings is an idea embraced by a growing number of his colleagues.\u00a0\n\u201cThe theme of the year has been \u2018let\u2019s all focus in on the cost of construction and on reducing the cost of housing,\u201d he said.\nWhat\u2019s the real cost driver?\nOpponents of the bill argue that in their quest for affordability, supporters have either picked the wrong villain \u2014 or, at the very least, approached the problem with a sledgehammer when what\u2019s needed is a scalpel. \n\u201cThere\u2019s just this idea that if you simplify things in some ways, it will help,\u201d said Merrian Borgeson, policy director with Natural Resources Defense Council, who calls the bill \u201cwell-intentioned\u201d if fundamentally flawed in its premise. \u201cThe driver of cost in California for housing is not code.\u201d\nThe state\u2019s building industry disagrees.\nAccording to estimates provided by the state industry association, major building standard updates over the last 15 years have added between $51,000 and $117,000 to construction costs on each single-family home. By far the largest estimated cost, with an upper end of $65,000, was the price tag on the water utility hook-up required for sprinkler systems mandated in new single-family homes since 2011. California, Maryland and Washington D.C. are the only state-level jurisdictions with this requirement.\nFor apartment buildings alone, a national study sponsored by the building industry attributed 11% of total development costs to changes in the International Code Council model codes since 2012.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s impossible to independently verify any of these estimates. But if code changes don\u2019t cost much, developers certainly seem to act as if they do. Reuben Duarte, a land-use planner with the California Chapter of the American Planning Association, said in the months before a scheduled code update, city planning departments are always the scene of \u201ca mad rush from developers who are trying to get in\u201d before the new rules go into effect.\nA code for cheaper construction\nMost of the big ticket changes to California\u2019s standards over the last decade have been about energy efficiency and electrification. Some of these requirements have added upfront costs for developers, said Matt Vespa, an attorney with the environmental legal nonprofit Earthjustice, but they ultimately save homeowners in the long-run.\u00a0\n\u201cThe cost of housing is just one part of affordability,\u201d he said. He pointed to possible energy code changes that would allow homes to calculate their electricity needs differently, potentially saving on costly capacity upgrades. \u201cThose energy code enhancements could save people money on their energy bills and that is part of affordability. Why is that completely not considered in this equation?\u201d\nIt\u2019s that prospect of preventing changes to the code that might actually save money that has even some pro-building, \u201cyes in my backyard\u201d advocates concerned about the bill as currently written.\nHow could the building code make a building less expensive to build? A 2023 law, for example, directs state regulators to consider letting developers build apartment buildings over three stories with just one staircase rather than at least two. Single stair construction is an architectural mainstay outside that United States that allows for more housing to occupy a given lot and is estimated to bring down construction costs on mid-sized apartment buildings by as much as 13% without obviously elevating fire risk.\nSchultz\u2019s bill includes a carve out for any future single stair changes. It also includes exceptions for code amendments aimed at making it easier to convert office buildings into apartments and condos, another legislative directive. But additional cost-saving changes could get frozen out.\u00a0\nOne possibility: Dallas, Texas recently adopted a new, relaxed set of codes for mid-sized apartment buildings, a considerable step down from the rules in place in most American cities where they share a set of standards with skyscrapers.\nSmith with the Center for Building said he understands why someone who \u201cjust doesn\u2019t trust that the building code development process is going to appropriately balance affordability and all the other concerns\u201d would support the bill. But \u201cit\u2019s a little upsetting to see everyone throwing the baby out with the bath water,\u201d he said.\nThe \u201cbaby,\u201d in this case, refers to possible cost-reducing changes that Smith said are more likely to be found for apartment buildings.\u00a0\n\u201cIf I were a single family developer, I\u2019d be a lot more happy with the code as it is than if I were a multifamily developer and a lot more eager to fix it in place,\u201d said Smith.\nSchultz stressed that though the bill has already passed out of the Assembly, it remains a work in progress. He said he is currently negotiating possible changes to the bill that would allow for a general \u201cescape hatch\u201d for any proposed \u201cchanges to the code that might actually reduce the cost of housing.\u201d\nAfter all, he added, \u201cthat is the goal.\u201d\nCorrection: A pending code update would be incorporated into state regulations even if the proposed moratorium takes effect. \n\n\n\nmore on california housing\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSafeguard independent news for California\u2019s future\nFor 10 years, CalMatters has informed millions of Californians and kept our government and special interests in check.\n\nWe report what\u2019s happening.\nWe ask the hard questions.\nWe make our government transparent to Californians.\n\nRight now, every donation is matched dollar-for-dollar.

    "title": "No more CEQA for most urban housing development in California - CalMatters",
    "content": "\n\n\nIn summary\nIn a legislative battle a decade in the making, lawmakers just exempted infill urban development from the California Environmental Quality Act. That\u2019s a big deal.\n\n\nA decade-spanning political battle between housing developers and defenders of California\u2019s preeminent environmental law likely came to an end this afternoon with only a smattering of \u201cno\u201d votes.\u00a0\nThe forces of housing won.\u00a0\nWith the passage of a state budget-related housing bill, the California Environmental Quality Act will be a non-issue for a decisive swath of urban residential development in California.\u00a0\nIn practice, that means most new apartment buildings will no longer face the open threat of environmental litigation.\u00a0\nIt also means most urban developers will no longer have to study, predict and mitigate the ways that new housing might affect local traffic, air pollution, flora and fauna, noise levels, groundwater quality and objects of historic or archeological significance.\nAnd it means that when housing advocates argue that the state isn\u2019t doing enough to build more homes amid crippling rents and stratospheric prices, they won\u2019t \u2014 with a few exceptions \u2014 have CEQA to blame anymore.\n\u201cSaying \u2018no\u2019 to housing in my community will no longer be state sanctioned,\u201d said Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat who introduced the CEQA law as a separate bill in March. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to solve all of our housing problems in the state, but it is going to remove the single biggest impediment to building environmentally friendly housing.\u201d\nUnlike most environmental laws, which explicitly mandate, monitor or ban certain environmental behavior, CEQA is just a public disclosure requirement. The 54-year-old statute requires state and local governments to study and publicize the likely environmental impact of any decisions they make. That includes the permitting of new housing.\u00a0\n \n\n\n\n\nJust the right amount of news\nJust the right amount of news\n\n\nGet California\u2019s most essential headlines without feeling overwhelmed.\nGet California\u2019s most essential headlines without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for years, the building industry and \u201cYes in my backyard\u201d activists have identified the law as a key culprit behind California\u2019s housing shortage. That\u2019s because the law allows any individual or group to sue if they argue that a required environmental study isn\u2019t accurate, expansive or detailed enough. Such lawsuits \u2014 and even the mere threat of them \u2014add a degree of delay, cost and uncertainty that make it impossible for the state to build its way to affordability, CEQA\u2019s critics argue.\nWith today\u2019s vote, the Legislature is putting that argument to the test. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who spent much of last week cajoling the Legislature to pass the bill as part of his budget package, signed it on Monday evening.\nNow the question is whether this monumental political and policy shift will actually result in more homes getting built in California\u2019s cities.\nMany of the bill\u2019s backers are optimistic.\n\u201cI think when we look back on what hopefully is California finally beginning to confront this housing crisis, this year \u2014 2025 \u2014 and this bill will be viewed as a turning point,\u201d said Matt Haney, a Democrat who represents San Francisco in the Assembly where he chairs the housing committee.\nOn paper, the new law, unlike most that deal with housing approvals and environmental regulation, is actually pretty straightforward.\nUrban \u201cinfill\u201d housing developments \u2014 housing built in and around existing development \u2014 are no longer subject to CEQA.\nThere are some exceptions and qualifiers, but development boosters say they are relatively minor.\u00a0\nThe exemption is \u201cthe most significant change to the California Environmental Quality Act\u2019s effect on housing production since CEQA was passed,\u201d said Louis Mirante, a lobbyist for the Bay Area Council, a business coalition that regularly pushes for legislation that makes it easier to build.\nThe bill is limited to projects under 20 acres, but that cap is only relevant to the biggest multi-block-spanning mega developments.\nA certain level of density is required, but it really only precludes using the policy for single-family home construction.\nBefore any project can move forward, any affiliated tribal government will have to be notified first, but the consultation is put on a short timeline.\nIn order to qualify for the exemption, a proposed project must also be consistent with local zoning, the regulations that determine what types of buildings can be constructed where. But thanks to another CEQA-chopping bill authored by San Francisco Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener that exempts many changes to zoning rules from CEQA and which is also packed into the budget, that appears less likely to be a real constraint.\u00a0\nTo buy off the ferocious opposition of the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California, a construction union umbrella group, the bill also includes some higher wage requirements.\u00a0\n\n\n\nRead Next\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nBut those rules are not likely to apply to most potential residential development projects. \u201cThe lion\u2019s share of housing being built\u201d in California will no longer be governed by CEQA, said Mark Rhoades, a planning and development consultant in Berkeley.\nTake a massive five-story apartment building spanning a full city block, said Bill Fulton, a longtime urban planner and professor at UC San Diego.\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about labor and you don\u2019t have to worry about CEQA? That\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he said.\nCEQA seachange\nWhat a difference nine years make.\nConsider how things went back in 2016 when then-Gov. Jerry Brown tried to ram a CEQA fix for California\u2019s rising housing costs through the state budget process. Brown\u2019s big idea was to \u201cstreamline\u201d the housing approval process, allowing developers to make an end-run around the California Environmental Quality Act, so long as they set aside a certain share of units for lower-income residents.\nA coalition of construction labor unions, environmental interests and local government groups torched the idea. The proposal didn\u2019t even get a vote.\nNearly a decade later, once again a Democratic governor opted to stuff a CEQA-trimming policy package through the budget process in the name of cheaper housing.\u00a0\nThe measure passed overwhelmingly in both the Senate and Assembly \u2014 and this time it didn\u2019t even include an affordability requirement.\n\nLearn more about legislators mentioned in this story.\n\nWicks\u2019 proposal is somewhat narrower than the 2016 version, exempting only infill. New suburban-style subdivisions carved from farmland or undeveloped sagebrush will not qualify.\u00a0\nThat infill focus has made it easier for the Democratic-controlled Legislature to swallow such a significant scaling back of California\u2019s signature environmental law. Promoting denser urban development generally means using less land, constructing new housing that uses less energy and setting up new residents to do a lot less driving.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen you are building housing in an existing community, that is environmentally beneficial, it is climate friendly, that is not something that should be subjected to potentially endless CEQA challenges and lawsuits,\u201d Wiener said on the Senate floor on Monday just prior to the vote, when the measure passed 28 to 5.\nEven so, Wicks\u2019 proposal always looked like a long shot.\u00a0\nSince Brown\u2019s failed gambit, lawmakers have managed to pass a raft of bills giving housing developers an escape route around CEQA. But those laws have always contained a trade-off. Developers get to skip CEQA, but in exchange they have to pay state-set \u201cprevailing wages\u201d (which typically work out to union-level pay), hire union workers outright, set aside a certain share of units for lower income residents, or some combination of the three.\u00a0\nThese conditions were born of political necessity. A CEQA lawsuit \u2014 or even the suggestion of one \u2014 makes for a powerful negotiating tool. Organized labor groups, most especially the building trades council, have not been keen to give up that leverage without getting something in return.\nAs housing developers proved less willing to use the new streamlining laws than those bills\u2019 sponsors and supporters had hoped, many pro-building advocates, academics and commentators began calling for environmental streamlining with no strings attached.\nWicks answered that call earlier this year. Under her proposal, infill developers would be allowed to ignore CEQA, full stop. That marked a major break from recent legislative precedent, and one that seemed a stretch, even with so many Democratic lawmakers carting around copies of Abundance.\nThe deal that almost wasn\u2019t\nJust last week, Wicks\u2019 proposal seemed on the verge of collapse.\nA version of the bill introduced last week included what amounted to a minor wage hike for the lowest paid construction workers, who are virtually all non-union. While the state\u2019s carpenters\u2019 union supported it, the trades council emphatically did not \u2014 with one of the groups\u2019 associated lobbyists likening it to Jim Crow. The trades objected so strenuously \u2014 arguing that it set dangerous precedent and undercut apprenticeship programs \u2014 that lawmakers removed the proposed wage change.\u00a0\nInstead, developers working on projects that are entirely designated to be affordable would now be required to pay prevailing wages in order to take advantage of the new law.\u00a0\nDevelopers of any projects over 85 feet tall would be required to hire a certain share of union workers. There are added restrictions for construction in San Francisco specifically.\nBy the standards of prior housing streamlining bills, those are relatively modest concessions. Most developments over 85 feet use concrete and steel frame construction, which require a higher skilled labor force that is often unionized anyway.\nMost entirely income-restricted housing projects make use of public subsidies that require paying union-level wages.\n\u201cAffordable housing is forced to play by different rules because the state has decided that if you are receiving public funds a certain wage should be attached to it,\u201d said Ray Pearl, executive director of the California Housing Consortium, which advocates for affordable housing construction. The addition of a prevailing wage requirement for affordable housing \u201cis a head scratcher,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it really is reaffirming existing policy.\u201d\nThat leaves every other type of housing project: Market rate and mixed-income apartment buildings under seven-or-so stories. For that type of construction, which defines the bulk of urban development in California, CEQA is soon to be entirely optional \u2014 no strings attached.\nThat this is the new trades-endorsed deal has been met with a perplexed kind of glee from some corners of the \u201cyes in my backyard\u201d movement. The new version of the bill \u201cis now *even better,*\u201d UC Davis law professor Chris Elmendorf marveled on Twitter.\nWill it matter?\nWhat will urban housing construction look like in California without CEQA?\nThere are no shortage of reasons not to build housing in California. Labor costs, even without regulatory requirements, are high. So are interest rates. Tariffs and aggressive immigration enforcement are more recent sources of uncertainty. Developers are always happy to complain about slow permitting, high local fees and inflexible building codes.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the CEQA costs that are holding up housing,\u201d said Rhoades, the Berkeley consultant.\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to make more development happen,\u201d he said of the budget bill. \u201cIt\u2019s going to make development that is already happening a little easier.\u201d\nCritics of the half-century-old environmental law can and do point to specific projects \u2014 housing for students, housing near public transit, affordable housing built upon city-owned parking lots \u2014 that have been sued in the name of the environment as examples of \u201cCEQA abuse.\u201d\nUnder the new laws, such litigation will largely go away in California\u2019s cities.\n\u201cThe one thing we do know is that CEQA is a time suck,\u201d said Ben Metcalf, managing director of UC Berkeley\u2019s Terner Center for Housing Innovation and the former head of the state\u2019s housing agency under Brown. \u201cIf you can just get out of that six months, nine months, twelve months of delay, that takes a whole cohort of projects and gets them in the ground sooner. In a state that\u2019s facing a housing crisis, that\u2019s not for nothing.\u201d\nBut the more important consequence of CEQA, many of its critics regularly argue, has been its chilling effect.\u00a0\nHow many new units of housing would have been built, but for concerns that they might become ensnared in environmental litigation? How many developers, anticipating a possible legal challenge, have preemptively pared back their plans? How many financiers of housing projects pulled out or demanded higher interest rates over such concerns?\nCalifornia may soon find out.\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nJune 27, 2025July 3, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nJune 30, 2025July 1, 2025 \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSafeguard independent news for California\u2019s future\nFor 10 years, CalMatters has informed millions of Californians and kept our government and special interests in check.\n\nWe report what\u2019s happening.\nWe ask the hard questions.\nWe make our government transparent to Californians.\n\nRight now, every donation is matched dollar-for-dollar.

    "content": "\nOne of the fiercest legislative fights of 2019 was over a bill limiting the amount that many California landlords can hike rent.\nSix years later, legislators were back at it again as the Assembly\u2019s housing committee took up a bill Thursday, authored by Democratic Assemblymember Ash Kalra of San Jose, which would:\u00a0\n\nReduce the cap from 10% to 5% (or 2% plus the current inflation rate, whichever is lower);\nExtend the law to single-family homes (currently exempt);\nMake the law permanent (current law sunsets in 2030).\n\nIf crowd size at a mid-morning weekday committee hearing is any indication, Assembly Bill 1157 is among the most contentious bills of the year. Advocates on both sides crowded into the hearing room and blocked the hallway outside in color-coded droves. Tenant advocates with the nonprofit Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment sported yellow; landlords allied with the California Apartment Association made up a sea of red.\u00a0\nSupporters of the bill argue that the current statutory cap is far too high for low-income renters, especially given the punishing inflation of the last few years, and that the carve-out for single-family homes is unfair.\n\nTammy Alvarado, a San Diego County renter and bill proponent: \u201cMost people\u2019s American dream is to buy a house and ours is just to remain in our house. Unless something changes, becoming homeless is a reality for my family.\u201d\n\nThe bill passed the committee, but narrowly, 7 to 5.\nMany Democrats, particularly in the Assembly, have trained their legislative focus this year on making it easier, cheaper and more enticing to build new housing. Even some of the lawmakers who voted for the bill Thursday did so half-heartedly, lamenting the cooling effect the policy might have on the construction of new homes at a time when the state is desperate for more overall supply.\nAs with current law, the bill would not apply to homes that are 15 years old or newer. Most economists agree that rent control measures do tend to discourage the construction of new homes and the upkeep of old ones, while providing financial stability to long-time renters. And as with any policy, the details matter.\nThe tension between supply boosters and skeptics is likely to become a dominant theme in this year\u2019s legislative session. On Monday, a major housing production bill stalled and another only barely skated by in the Senate Housing Committee, when the chairperson called the bills\u2019 lack of hardcoded affordability requirements a \u201cnon-starter.\u201d\u00a0\nTwo days later, over in the Assembly, Speaker Robert Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, issued his list of priority housing legislation. Notably, AB 1157 did not make the cut.\n\n",

    "content": "\nOur Economy and the Big Picture\nSome tenants are against rent control because they are against government regulation, think most landlords are honest, that tenants are suffering their own consequences somehow, and that the free market will make everything OK. It is the conservative propaganda that big landlord money pays to keep shouting, much as Hitler\u2019s propaganda worked. The repeated lie eventually sounds true.\nHousing is a necessity of life, with food and water. It is different from normal things we buy for that reason. Housing has an \u201cinelastic demand\u201d and an \u201cinelastic supply\u201d, meaning that new housing construction is very slow to react to increased demand, and we don\u2019t really have a choice as to whether we will have a place to live. In the 4 decades that landlords have fought rent control on the theory that it will discourage new construction, hardly any new construction has occurred, anyway, and most notably in cities where new construction is expressly exempted from rent controls. It is a lie, proven over time.\nWe regulate how much utilities can be charged because it is worth a lot more than we pay to have them, and our money should not be diverted away from other purchases by overcharging for them. No one questions that. Even the pure free market thinkers do not question whether the Securities and Exchange Commission should regulate the stock market, because it benefits them. Why not housing?\nWe have an entire economy to think of, not just tenants and landlords. Landlords are about 2% of the population, while tenants are 66%. The tenants\u2019 money greatly affects the entire economy. Tenants want to buy clothes, food, entertainment, equipment, vacations, and gifts. The tenant dollar goes only so far. When the landlord raises the rent, the tenants have less money to spend elsewhere, which hurts all of the other businesses, as well as the tenants. The reduction in those sales has a \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d which causes the total money in circulation to be reduced by 5 times that amount, in a chain reaction: A has less money to spend with B, who lacks that money to spend at C, and so forth. The entire economy suffers so that the richest 2% can get even richer.\nMeanwhile, the employers of those tenants face not only the reduced sales, but are forced to pay higher wages to keep the tenants because their rents were increased. Indeed, when the minimum wage is increased, the benefit is immediately removed because the landlord takes it all. The employer still has to pay more, and either cuts profits or has to lay off the workers. In addition, the landlord of the employer\u2019s business raises the employer\u2019s rent, too, so higher rents and higher wages for the employer make survival difficult. Many businesses fail for that reason, and homeowners who were against rent control lose their business and then their home in foreclosure and become tenants, themselves, before becoming homeless. Add to this the mass relocation which has already started from rising ocean levels caused by global warming, and the housing crisis kicks into overdrive Meanwhile, American businesses who can survive by raising their prices to the consumer have gradually lost their competitive edge in the face of products overseas, leading to massive bankruptcies, layoffs and a severe depression from which we may never recover.\nThe growing homeless population itself is the natural result of laissez faire economics. In the economic terms of supply and demand, the market price is what sellers and buyers both agree on. If the price is too high, the buyer doesn\u2019t buy, and the seller has to lower the price to sell. If the price of housing is too high, you become homeless, but the landlord does not have to lower rents because other people who can afford the higher price will fill the vacancy. Homeless people can get a free room and food by committing crimes and having the tax payers pay for their jail time and associated police and court expense. Why not? They have nothing to lose and at least room and board to gain? It is part of that free market, is it not? Wandering bands of homeless families trying to survive in this free market system are given few choices, and cannot be controlled. The free market says they should survive any way they can. Why interfere with the landlord\u2019s profits with government regulation when we can have a society like that?\nWith the economy weakened by these factors, the gross national product plummets, and with it the tax base for our government to provide military defense, health care, schools, and infrastructure also collapses. We lose the middle class, and have in the end a feudal society, with the very few ultra rich and the helpless poor masses. Granted that is several years off, something only our children will have to face, not us.\n\n",

    "content": "\n\n\n\nBlog\nRent Control\n\n\n\t\t\tAHF Rent Control Measure Analysis \n\n\n\n\nBy Max Dubler\nIntroduction\n(Updated to reflect that this measure has been placed on the ballot as Proposition 33)\nIn November 2024, California will vote on Proposition 33, also known as the Justice For Renters Act, a ballot measure that removes state-level restrictions on local governments\u2019 power to enact rent control.\nThis analysis of the measure is intended to help pro-housing voters understand the relevant policy and legal issues, Prop 33\u2019s likely impact on housing markets, and how California YIMBY reached its position.\nWe conclude that the Justice For Renters Act is a poorly-conceived, over-broad measure that will likely worsen housing affordability by empowering NIMBY jurisdictions to block new housing. We recommend an oppose position.\nBackground: Rent Control and Existing Rent Regulation Law\n\u201cRent control\u201d is a blanket term that describes a variety of policies that affect housing costs, affordability, and markets in different ways. \u201cRent control\u201d can refer to everything from modest limits on how much a landlord can raise the rent each year, to bans on rent increases, to outright price controls that determine how much rent can be charged for a home.\nThe primary reason to regulate rents is to prevent economic displacement, or people being forced to move out of their long-time homes because the market price of housing has risen steeply.\nIn other words, rent control provides tenants with security of tenure by preventing them from getting priced out of their homes. Note that rent control does not reduce the cost of housing; it just slows the rate at which housing becomes more expensive for renters who already have housing. Strong rent control can protect tenants from displacement, but it is not a recipe for broad housing affordability.\u00a0\nRent control can make it financially infeasible to build new housing or maintain existing buildings. Building a new apartment building costs money. If the revenue generated by the new homes is not sufficient to cover construction and maintenance costs, then new homes won\u2019t get built: investors are willing to take on some financial risk, but not if the likelihood of losing money is guaranteed. In such cases, the housing shortage gets worse, and rents and home prices get higher in all of the existing homes.\nFortunately, there is a policy fix for this: exempting buildings from rent control for the first 15 or 20 years of their existence. By the time rent control takes effect \u2013 and as long as it allows for customary operating and maintenance expenses \u2013 most buildings will have stable rental income, meaning the risk that builders and owners face from rent regulation is greatly diminished. As a result, a rolling rent control policy that exempts newer buildings will not disincentivize construction.\nAlso, the point of regulating rents is to protect vulnerable tenants who may not be able to find replacement housing at prices they can afford. Because brand new apartment buildings are always more expensive to build than older apartments, they tend to attract tenants with higher incomes who are more able to afford market-rate rents than some long-time residents of older buildings.\nIn short, limiting rent stabilization to older, less-expensive buildings protects the most vulnerable tenants without creating financial risks that discourage the construction of badly-needed housing.\nMaintaining and operating existing buildings also costs money. If the rent a landlord can collect is not high enough to cover maintenance and operating costs, they will neglect their buildings.\nWe see this in declining industrial cities with high vacancy rates, like Detroit, where the market price of rent is not high enough to fund basic building maintenance. In such places, landlords neglect their properties, with deleterious effects for tenants.\nSimilar neglect issues persist in cities with high housing demand and extreme rent control, like Mumbai, where strict rent controls and inflation have eroded the value of the rent that landlords are allowed to collect. Some rents are held at pre-1940 levels, which works out to less than $10 a month for some apartments. Because that rent is nowhere near enough to cover basic structural maintenance costs, older buildings regularly collapse in heavy rains.\nNew York City\u2019s vacancy controls, which prevent landlords from resetting rents on some pre-war apartments to market rates when tenants move out, have a similar effect: landlords hold tens of thousands of these apartments off the market because allowable rents are not high enough to pay for the repairs and renovations necessary to make them fit for human habitation.\nAllowing for modest rent increases, roughly in line with inflation or wage growth \u2014 and allowing rents to reset at market rates between tenants \u2014 preserves tenants\u2019 stability of tenure while ensuring building managers have enough operating income to maintain their buildings.\nCurrent law limits the ability of local jurisdictions to impose rent control. The Costa Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995 forbids cities from imposing vacancy control\u2014limits on how much a landlord can raise rent between tenants\u2014on any housing and forbids the imposition of rent controls on single family homes, condos, and any housing built after February 1, 1995.\nCalifornia has statewide rent stabilization. AB 1482 (2019) imposes statewide rent stabilization on most rental housing more than 15 years old, limiting allowable rent increases to 10% or 5% plus inflation, whichever is lower. The law also grants most tenants \u201cgood cause\u201d eviction protections, which forbid landlords from declining to renew a lease unless the tenant has failed to pay rent or has violated the terms of their lease. California YIMBY supported the passage of AB 1482.Some cities go beyond the state\u2019s rent stabilization rules. Local rent stabilization ordinances, notably in Los Angeles and San Francisco, further limit rent increases. In San Francisco, the maximum allowable increase is set at 60% of local CPI. Los Angeles\u2019 Rent Stabilization Ordinance is based on inflation, with allowances for greater increases in the event of capital improvements, seismic retrofitting, and renovations. San Jose limits rent increases to 5%.\nProposal\nThe Justice For Renters Act is a state ballot measure proposed by a subsidiary of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), a Los-Angeles based philanthropy that has been criticized as a \u201cslumlord\u201d for its continued poor management of single room occupancy housing for formerly-homeless tenants. AHF tenants have been found to reside in dangerous conditions that have led to severe injury. (Thanks to a loophole in federal Medicaid policy, AHF makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year from its chain of pharmacies, which it frequently uses to fund political campaigns.)\nThe measure itself reads as follows: \u201cThe state may not limit the right of any city, county, or city and county to maintain, enact or expand residential rent control.\u201d\nIf passed, this measure would empower cities to impose any form of rent control they wanted. They would be able to require rent control on new construction, implement vacancy control, and mandate below-inflation rent stabilization. Further, they would not be required to include \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d that allow rents to rise when landlords add improvements like seismic retrofitting or upgrades for habitability.\nAssessment\nThe measure would empower jurisdictions to deliberately make new multifamily development financially infeasible. As discussed above, well-designed rent control policies need not discourage new housing development.\nHowever, cities that do want to block new housing construction would gain a powerful new tool if the Justice For Renters Act passes. By mandating strict, below-inflation rent control with vacancy control for all new multifamily housing, a city could make essentially all new multifamily housing financially infeasible to build. Indeed, a Huntington Beach city councilman has already expressed his enthusiasm for the measure on these grounds according to Politico (emphasis added):\n[Huntington Beach City Councilmember Tony] Strickland said [the Justice For Renters Act] would block \u201cthe state\u2019s ability to sue our city\u201d because Huntington Beach could slap steep affordability requirements on new, multi-unit apartment projects that are now exempt from rent control. Such requirements, he argued, could stop development that would \u201cdestroy the fabric\u201d of the town\u2019s quaint \u201cSurf City\u201d vibe.\nThis bears repeating: anti-housing lawmakers who do not care about housing affordability are supporting the Justice For Renters Act because they want to weaponize bad-faith rent controls to get out of having to follow state housing law.\nSome rent regulations allowed under this rule could have unintended consequences, even if introduced in good faith. If granted the authority, some city governments may pass poorly designed rent control regulations that have unintended consequences. This has already happened elsewhere.\nIn Saint Paul, a local ballot initiative applying rent control to new construction cut new housing permit applications in half before the city council amended it to exempt new construction. In New York City, as noted above, 26,000 older, vacancy-controlled apartments that need major renovations and repairs currently sit empty because the allowable rent increases are not high enough to cover the cost of making them habitable.\nSome cities, notably Pasadena, have already passed rent control ballot initiatives that call for the immediate imposition of vacancy control in the event of a Costa Hawkins repeal or override.\nCurrent state law strikes a reasonable balance on rent stabilization. AB 1482, the statewide rent stabilization and good cause eviction law that passed in 2019, already includes best practices for rent control and eviction protection. By limiting rent increases, AB 1482 protects tenants from landlord rent gouging; and by exempting buildings less than 15 years old, it avoids restricting the housing supply.AB 1482 was further strengthened by the passage of SB 567 (2023), which tightens eviction protections and gives tenants the right to sue their landlord for damages if they illegally raise the rent.\nRecommendation\nOppose\n\n",

    "content": "\n\n\n\nBlog\nLegislation\n\n\n\t\t\tCalifornia YIMBY Statement on AB 1157 \n\n\n\t\t\t\tApril 24, 2025\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tCalifornia YIMBY\t\t\t\n\n\n\nCalifornians are rightly frustrated over the spiraling cost of rent. Due to our acute housing shortage, hundreds of thousands of Californians are forced to spend most of their income on rent, live in overcrowded conditions, or leave the state each year.\u00a0\nThis is not an abstract issue for us. Nearly every member of our team is a renter.\nFor this reason, California YIMBY supported and helped pass AB 1482, the most significant tenant protections ever enacted in California state law. The bill capped rent increases at 5% plus inflation, with a maximum annual increase of 10% \u2013 and also provided just-cause requirements for landlords seeking to evict their tenants.\nThese protections were an important stop-gap, and also weren\u2019t perfect \u2013 rent control regulations can have unintended consequences. But the ultimate way to protect tenants is to ensure that they have lots of housing options when a landlord tries to increase the rent; that requires housing abundance. Landlords should be competing for tenants, not the other way around.\nWe also need to be clear-eyed about the views and actions of California voters, who have been asked three times at the ballot to express their opinions on strict rent control. On all three occasions, they have rejected it.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, due almost entirely to our acute housing shortage and affordability crisis, thousands of working-class Californians flee the state every year for states that build more homes. These are almost always states where rent control is prohibited by state law, where unfunded inclusionary zoning is prohibited by state law, and where there are limited taxpayer resources for affordable housing.\u00a0\nThe message should be clear: We don\u2019t have a rent control crisis; we don\u2019t have an inclusionary zoning crisis; we have a homebuilding crisis, much of which is due to the costly, byzantine, and too-often unrealistic expectations about increasing the cost of new homes to pay the cost of fixing a variety of social ills.\nWhile the provisions of AB 1157 are well-intentioned, we are concerned that imposing increasingly strict price controls every few years could dissuade the housing production our state needs \u2013 addressing a symptom of the crisis while making the underlying disease worse.\u00a0\nNotably, the law extends price controls to ADUs, which has been one of the only bright spots in California housing in recent years.\nThese concerns were raised during committee proceedings, and we share these concerns with our partners and allies.\nWe appreciate Asm. Kalra\u2019s steadfast commitment to protecting vulnerable tenants and renters from rising rents and evictions. We are committed to working with him on pro-housing, pro-renter reforms that will achieve our shared goals without the risk of unintended consequences to our urgent housing production goals.\n\n",

Yet, over the past decade, production has averaged fewer than 80,000 homes annually\u2014and current rates remain well below the mark. (See housing production trends from 2005\u20132022.)\nPolicy Recommendations to Accelerate Housing Production: The California Building Industry Association has identified a range of actionable policy solutions\u2014some that involve straightforward enforcement of existing laws, and others that require broader reforms to streamline construction and increase housing supply. We urge the Legislature to take meaningful action to remove obstacles to homebuilding and ensure California can deliver the homes needed to achieve Housing for All.\nLow-Cost, High-Impact Policy Fixes (\u201cEasy Wins\u201d):\n\nEnforce timely issuance of Certificates of OccupancyEnsure jurisdictions comply with the California Building Code by issuing Certificates of Occupancy promptly. This low-cost step helps move completed, approved homes to market more quickly.\nEnforce partial release of subdivision bonds under the Subdivision Map ActRequire jurisdictions to follow existing law by releasing subdivision bonds in a timely manner, reducing financing costs and speeding up project completion.\nAuthorize HCD enforcement of existing housing lawsGrant the California Department of Housing and Community Development the authority to enforce state housing laws. The potential for investigation and loss of funding will encourage greater local compliance.\nRequire plaintiff identification in CEQA lawsuitsIncrease transparency by mandating the disclosure of the individuals or entities filing lawsuits under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).\n\nBroader Structural Reforms (\u201cHeavier Lifts\u201d):\n\nLocal Impact Fees\nCap or scale fees so they reflect the true cost of providing services for new developments. Eliminate or reduce \u201cdiscretionary\u201d developer requirements that drive up costs and delay projects.\nRHNA (Regional Housing Needs Assessment) Reform\nLink RHNA compliance to state and regional funding to incentivize local governments. Align RHNA targets with job growth data to prioritize housing near employment centers. Measure compliance based on actual housing units approved and built\u2014not just planning metrics.\nCEQA Litigation Reform\nLimit repeated litigation: Once a project has corrected deficiencies identified through CEQA litigation, it should be protected from further CEQA-related lawsuits on the same grounds.\nLocal Planning and Approval Reforms\nStandardize and simplify building codes and design guidelines to reduce delays and promote more efficient development. Require timely, meaningful responses from local agencies on submitted plans and permit applications. Prohibit the downsizing of already-approved projects, which undermines housing capacity and investor confidence.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "AB 1482 provides statewide rent increase limitations and just cause for eviction protections in California.\nThe current applicable CPI increase for our jurisdiction (that is, from August 1, 2024 to July 31, 2025), is 3.8%. Thus, the maximum annual increase for units subject to the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB1482) limitations is currently 8.8% (3.8% + 5%). If the increase is effective on or after August 1, 2025, a different CPI increase will apply.\u00a0If you are a member of California Apartment Association, you can calculate the maximum allowable contract rent increase here:\u00a0https://caanet.org/topics/ab-1482/.\nThis information covers aspects of AB 1482 related to rent increase limitations but does not cover every aspect and is not a substitute for reading the law itself, which can be found at this link:\u00a0https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1482\nThe Housing Authority can provide general guidance on what the law requires but cannot provide legal advice.\nOVERVIEW OF AB 1482\nAB 1482 is a statewide law that went into effect on January 1, 2020 and expires on January 1, 2030. It does two main things:\n\nRequires a landlord to have a \u201cjust cause\u201d in order to terminate a tenancy.\nLimits annual rent increases to no more than 5% + local CPI, or 10%, whichever is lower. CPI refers to the Consumer Price Index, which reflects the inflation rate.\n\nA tenant may not waive their rights to these protections and any agreement to do so by the tenant is not enforceable.\nAB 1482 DOES NOT CHANGE OR REPLACE OR LIMIT ANY LOCAL RENT ORDINANCE\nIf a unit is already covered by an ordinance limiting rent increases, the unit remains subject to the local ordinance. In other words, 1482 does not limit, change, or take away the rent control for those units. The owner must abide by the most restrictive limitations.\nUNITS THAT ARE EXEMPT FROM BOTH THE \u201cJUST CAUSE\u201d EVICTION PROVISIONS AND RENT LIMITATIONS\n\nUnits that were constructed within the last 15 years. This applies on a rolling basis.\u00a0 For example, a unit constructed on January 1, 2006 is exempt as of January 1,\u00a0 2020, but becomes covered by AB 1482 protections on and after January 1, 2021.\nAffordable housing units.\nCertain dormitories.\nA two-unit property, if the second unit was occupied by an owner of the property for the entire period of the tenancy.\nSingle-family homes and condominiums are only exempt if the two conditions discussed below apply.\n\nExemption Conditions for Single-Family Homes and Condominiums\nSingle-family homes and condominiums are only exempt from AB 1482 if BOTH of the following conditions apply:\n\nThe property is\u00a0not\u00a0owned by one of the following: a real estate trust, a corporation, or an LLC with at least one corporate member.AND\nThe landlord notified the tenant in writing that the tenancy is not subject to the \u201cjust cause\u201d and rent increase limitations as specifically described in Civil Code Sections 1946.2I(8)(B)(i) and 1947.12(d)(5)(B)(i).\u00a0More information about this requirement, including mandatory language, is provided in the Assembly Bill\n\nThe limited exemption for single-family homes does not apply where there is more than one dwelling unit on the same lot, or any second residential unit in the building that cannot be sold separately from the subject unit (such as an in-law unit).\nUNITS EXEMPT FROM THE RENT LIMITATIONS\n\nUnits that are already subject to a local rent control ordinance that restricts annual rent increases to an amount less than 5% + CPI.\n\nRENT INCREASE LIMITS UNDER AB 1482\n\nFor covered units, annual rent increases are limited to no more than 5% plus the percentage change in the cost of living for the region in which the property is located, or 10%, whichever is lower. \u201cPercentage change in the cost of living\u201d means the percentage change in the\u00a0Consumer Price Index\u00a0(CPI) for All Urban Consumers for All Items for the metropolitan area in which the property is located, as published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. If a regional index is not available, the CPI Index for All Urban Consumers for all items, as determined by the Department of Industrial Relations, shall apply.\nFor rent increases that take effect before August 1 of any calendar year, the percentage change is calculated using the amount published for April (or March, if no amount is published for April) of the immediately preceding calendar year and April (or March) of the year before that.\nFor rent increases that take effect on or after August 1 of any calendar year, the percentage change is calculated using the amount published for April (or March, if no amount is published for April) of that calendar year and April (or March) of the immediately preceding calendar year.\nThe percentage change must be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of one percent.\nNo more than two increases in a 12-month period, and the combined amount cannot exceed the 5% + CPI cap.\nThe total rent paid by subtenants to a master tenant cannot exceed the rent charged by the landlord.\nThere is no limit on the initial rent charged for a vacant unit.\n\n",

For those who own multifamily properties built before 2010 (15+ years ago), rent increases aren\u2019t arbitrary\u2014they\u2019re capped based on inflation and state law.\nIf you\u2019re managing real estate in California, staying on top of these changes isn\u2019t optional\u2014it\u2019s a must. Let\u2019s walk through what\u2019s changed, how much you can raise rent from August 1, 2025, through July 31, 2026, and what you need to know to avoid legal and financial headaches.\n\nQuick Recap: What Is AB 1482?\nAB 1482, formally known as the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, places statewide rent control and eviction protections on certain residential rental properties in California.\nThe law applies to:\n\n\nMulti-family residential units more than 15 years old\n\n\nProperties not subject to local rent control ordinances\n\n\nProperties not exempted (more on that below)\n\n\nThe law sets a limit on how much rent can be raised annually, calculated as 5% plus the applicable Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase for that region.\n\n\ud83d\udcca 2025\u20132026 Rent Increase Caps (Based on CPI Data)\nWith the new CPI data published, landlords can now calculate the maximum allowable increases:\nIf your property is outside these counties, CPI rates for other areas will be published by the California Department of Industrial Relations in June 2025.\n\nWho\u2019s Exempt From AB 1482?\nNot every property falls under AB 1482. Here are common exemptions:\n\n\nSingle-family homes or condos, if the owner is an individual (not a corporate entity) and gives proper notice to tenants\n\n\nNew construction (built within the past 15 years)\n\n\nAffordable housing governed by regulatory agreements or tax credits\n\n\nOwner-occupied duplexes where one unit is occupied by the owner\n\n\nStill, exemptions are not automatic. You need to provide the correct legal notices to tenants under California Civil Code \u00a71946.2.\n\nHow to Calculate Your Rent Increase Legally\nHere\u2019s a quick example using San Diego County\u2019s 8.8% limit:\nLet\u2019s say the current rent is $2,000.The max rent increase allowed = $2,000 x 0.088 = $176/monthNew maximum rent = $2,176/month\nMake sure your calculation includes:\n\n\nBase rent (not including utilities or other fees)\n\n\nEffective date of the rent increase (must fall between Aug 1, 2025 \u2013 July 31, 2026)\n\n\nProper written notice to the tenant (at least 30 days for increases under 10%, 90 days for more)\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhat Happens If You Exceed the Cap?\nThis is where many landlords get tripped up. Increasing rent beyond the allowable limit can lead to:\nAccording to Davidovich Stone Law Group, failure to comply with rent control laws is a common\u2014and expensive\u2014legal mistake. Legal missteps can erode property value and expose you to long-term risk.\n\nPro Tips for California Property Owners\nWant to stay compliant and still protect your ROI? Keep these in mind:\n\n\nDocument everything \u2014 Notices, calculation sheets, CPI rates used\n\n\nGive proper notice \u2014 Include the required language under Civil Code \u00a71946.2\n\n\nCheck for exemptions yearly \u2014 Construction age and ownership status can shift applicability\n\n\nReview local rent ordinances \u2014 Some cities have stricter rules than AB 1482\n\n\nWork with legal counsel \u2014 Especially if you manage multiple properties or receive tenant pushback\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nLegal Support From Davidovich Stone Law Group\nIf you have questions about:\n\n\nCalculating rent increases correctly\n\n\nDetermining if your property qualifies for exemption\n\n\nDrafting legally compliant tenant notices\n\n\nDefending against tenant complaints\n\n\nDavidovich Stone Law Group provides comprehensive legal services for California property owners and landlords.

    "title": "\"AB 1482 - Tenant Protection Act and Its Impacts on Tenants, Landlords,\" by Ava Lau",
    "content": "\nAbstract\nWith housing shortages and rent steadily increasing, many long-time tenants are in favor of passing rent control laws. Advocates argue that rent control offers many benefits, including providing security for tenants against rising rents, providing affordable housing to tenants, and protecting vulnerable tenants from displacement. Its benefits include allowing tenants to achieve better financial stability, keeping families in their homes, and preventing working-class tenants, seniors, and vulnerable members of society from being priced out of their long-time residences and neighborhoods. Without rent control, lower-income tenants would have difficulty securing and keeping a home. At the same time, landlords benefit from rent control because tenants are more inclined to stay in the property long-term. Fewer tenant turnovers mean less hassle and stress for the landlord. It saves them money because vacancy periods could result in landlords realizing a loss on the property. However, this is far from a win-win situation.\nA substantial body of research has found that rent control often backfires and has quite the opposite effect of keeping housing affordable. One research study by Stanford Economists Rebecca Diamond, Timothy McQuade, and Franklin Qian examined the consequences of San Francisco\u2019s 1994 ballot initiative to expand rent control. They found that while the expansion of rent control prevented tenant displacement, the landlords in San Francisco responded to the law by withdrawing from the rental market, selling their properties, and converting their rent-controlled buildings into condominiums. The overall supply of rental housing declined as landlords converted their apartment buildings into higher-end condominiums and replaced old structures with new construction to avoid rent control regulations. The reduction in rental housing led to rent increases in the long run. It also shifted the city\u2019s housing supply towards less affordable housing since many multi-family housing structures were converted to condominiums and new construction. These shifts in the housing supply drove up rent and decreased the supply of affordable housing. It also inadvertently created a housing stock that catered to higher-income individuals. Ultimately, the authors found that rent control created the very outcome it wanted to avoid \u2013 a decline in the number of renters living in rent-controlled units and a housing stock which was less affordable than before.\n\n\nRecommended Citation\n\n    Lau, Ava, \"AB 1482 \u2013 Tenant Protection Act and Its Impacts on Tenants, Landlords, and the Broader Housing Market\" (2021).

CBIA members build nearly 9 out of 10 new housing units built in California, including charity homes, legally defined as affordable housing, middle-class market-rate housing and luxury homes. \nDan Dunmoyer is the current President and CEO of the organization.[1]\n\n\nThe CBIA was established in 1943 as a federation of local and regional associations representing builders at the state level and functioned solely as a lobbying organization. In 1952, the organization incorporated as the California Home Builders Council. In 1968, the organization changed its name to the California Builders Council. In 1977, the organization became a full-service state level association. In 1978, the organization changed its name to the California Building Industry Association. There are now 10 regional affiliates.[2][3]\nSince 1977, a political action committee (PAC) and two subsidiary organizations have been established. The Building Industry Institute[4] was created in 1994 and is involved in researching strategies to benefit the building industry. The California Homebuilding Foundation[5] is an educational foundation that promotes the continued education of individuals and organizations interested in the building industry. The CHF also funds research to benefit the building industry.[citation needed] In addition to lobbying, the CBIA has incorporated technical, membership, insurance, and educational departments.[citation needed]\nThe CBIA sponsors the Pacific Coast Builders Conference, a regional building conference and trade show [6] which draws thousands of attendees and exhibitors each year.\n\nIn 2008, the CBIA ended a consulting agreement with Alan Nevin, a San Diego economist.[7]\nIn 2010, the CBIA objected to a proposed Los Angeles law that would require new homes, larger developments, and some redevelopment projects to prevent stormwater runoff from reaching the ocean. According to the Los Angeles Times, \"The law was designed to mitigate the negative effects of urbanization by controlling runoff at its source with small, cost-effective natural systems instead of treatment facilities. Reducing runoff improves water quality and recharges groundwater...Under the ordinance, builders would be required to use rainwater storage tanks, permeable pavement, infiltration swales or curb bump-outs to manage the water where it falls. Builders unable to manage 100% of a project's runoff on site would be required to pay a penalty of $13 a gallon of runoff not handled there -- a requirement the Building Industry Association has been fighting.\"[8]\n\n",

Sometimes referred to as the \"eyes and ears\" of the Legislature, the office is known for analyzing the state budget with the aim of making government programs more effective and less costly.[1]\nThe LAO was the first such institution in the United States that was designed to help both houses of a legislature manage the state budget in a strictly nonpartisan fashion; it inspired the creation of many similar agencies in other states, as well as the creation of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in 1974. The LAO should not be confused with the California Legislative Counsel (a position established in 1913), which does not focus primarily on the budget.[citation needed]\nThe LAO is overseen by the Joint Legislative Budget Committee (JLBC), a 16-member bipartisan committee. The office has a staff of 43 analysts and approximately 13 support staff. The analytical staff is divided into four subject areas: Corrections, Environment, and Transportation; State and Local Finance; Education; and Health and Human Services.[2]\nThe office was founded when the JLBC appointed the first \"Legislative Auditor\" on October 8, 1941, to assist with the state budgeting process. Because it was frequently confused with the state auditor, the title was changed to \"Legislative Analyst\" in 1957.\nThe office has had six Legislative Analysts since its creation.[3] Rolland Vandegrift served from 1941 to 1949, A. Alan Post served from 1949 to 1977, William Hamm served from 1977 to 1986, Elizabeth Hill served from 1986 to 2008, Mac Taylor served from 2008 to 2018, and currently Gabriel Petek serves as legislative analyst.[4]\n[5]\nOne of the most important responsibilities of the LAO has been to analyze the annual Governor's budget and publish a detailed review at the end of February. The office has presented a series of analyses from the beginning to the end of the budget process on overarching fiscal issues and specific departmental budget proposals and offered its recommendations for legislative action. In order to provide the Legislature with timely advice on these matters, the LAO has published its budget comments and advice in the form of separate written reports, handouts for hearings, and entries on a Web-based online list, all of which are available at its website. These documents help set the agenda for the work of the Legislature's fiscal committees in developing a state budget. Staff of the office work with these committees throughout the budget process and provide public testimony on the office's recommendations.\nMore generally, the office is a staff resource to all legislators. The LAO also performs the following functions:\n\nBudget \"Control.\" The LAO reviews requests by the administration to make changes to the budget after it is enacted. These reviews are used primarily by members of the JLBC and the fiscal committees.\nSpecial Reports. Throughout the year, the office prepares special reports on the state budget and topics of interest to the Legislature.\nInitiatives and Ballot Measures. The office estimates the fiscal effect on state and local government of all proposed initiatives (prior to circulation) and prepares analyses of all measures that qualify for the statewide ballot.\nForecasting. The LAO forecasts the state revenues and expenditures.\n\n\n^ Ingram, Carl (April 9, 1993). \"Brown Grants Funds for Legislative Analyst Office\u00a0: Budget: Speaker quietly approves Assembly's half of the fiscal advisory agency's $3.4-million cost\".

    "content": "Member Bank of Federal Reserve\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (informally referred to as the San Francisco Fed) is the federal bank for the twelfth district in the United States. The twelfth district is made up of nine western states\u2014Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington\u2014plus the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and Guam. The San Francisco Fed has branch offices in Los Angeles, Portland, Salt Lake City, and Seattle. It also has a cash processing center in Phoenix.\nThe twelfth district is the nation's largest by area and population, covering 1.3\u00a0million\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (3.4\u00a0million\u00a0km2), or 36% of the nation's area, and 60 million people. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco is the second-largest by assets held, after New York.[1] In 2004 the San Francisco Fed processed 20.8 billion currency notes and 1.5 billion commercial checks.[citation needed]\nThe Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco has one of the largest collections of US paper money in the United States, which is displayed in the American Currency Exhibit.[citation needed]\nMary C. Daly serves as the President and CEO as of October 1, 2018.[2]  Notable former Presidents include John C. Williams (2011\u20132018), who now holds the same role at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York[3] and is Vice Chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee,[4] as well as Janet Yellen (2004\u20132010), who held the role of Chair of the Board of Governors from 2014 to 2018.[5]\n\n\nThe San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank opened for business in rented quarters at the rear of the Merchants National Bank on November 16, 1914, in order to make the reserve provisions of the Federal Reserve Act. In 1924, the San Francisco staff moved out of temporary locations and into the Bank's newly built headquarters at 400 Sansome Street, a location that it would occupy for the next 60 years. In 1983, the bank relocated to 101 Market Street.\n\nFederal reserve districts, of which the 12th is largest and most populous\nMap of the Twelfth District\nAfter the bank's creation, a number of branches were opened to provide services across the district.[6]\n\nAlthough not a stand-alone branch, the bank opened the Phoenix Cash Processing Center in 2001.[11]\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade of the old Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at 400 Sansome Street\nArcade of the current building along Market Street\nThe old headquarters building of the bank, designed by George W. Kelham, has an Ionic colonnade that is pure Beaux-Arts, while the upper building is in the new Moderne fashion of 1924. The lobby with murals by Jules Guerin who created the palette for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exhibition. In 1983 the bank relocated to larger and more modern facilities on 101 Market Street as the 400 Sansome Street location was sold to private developers who rented out the space. Prominent law firm Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe was headquartered in the building until 2002 when the firm moved out of the space. The building continues to be owned by private developers and current tenants include the Bar Association of San Francisco.  It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).\nThe old 1929 Los Angeles branch building is also NRHP-listed. In 1987 the branch relocated to an adjacent new building at the corner of South Grand Ave and Olympic Blvd.[12]\nFrom 1951 to 2008, the Seattle branch was headquartered at the Federal Reserve Bank Building in Downtown Seattle, which had been built in 1951 for the branch and is listed on the NRHP.[13]\n\nThe following people serve on the board of directors as of June\u00a02025[update]:[14]\n\n\n\nName\n\nTitle\n\nClass\n\nTerm Expires\n\n\nJeffrey Newgard\n\nChairman, president, and CEO, Bank of Idaho, Idaho Falls, Idaho\n\nA\n\n2025\n\n\nClint Stein\n\nCEO, Umpqua Bank, Tacoma, Washington\n\nA\n\n2027\n\n\nLaura Lee Stewart\n\nPresident and CEO, Sound Community Bank and Sound Financial Bancorporation, Seattle, Washington\n\nA\n\n2026\n\n\nMaritza Diaz\n\nCEO, ITJ USA, San Diego, California\n\nB\n\n2025\n\n\nKaren Kimbrough\n\nChief Economist, LinkedIn, Sunnyvale, California\n\nB\n\n2026\n\n\nJack Sinclair\n\nCEO, Sprouts Farmers Market, Phoenix, Arizona\n\nB\n\n2024\n\n\nRussell Childs (chair)\n\nPresident and CEO, SkyWest, Inc., St. George, Utah\n\nC\n\n2026\n\n\nMario Cordero\n\nCEO, Port of Long Beach, Long Beach, California\n\nC\n\n2025\n\n\nPallavi Mehta Wahi (deputy chair)\n\nSeattle Managing Partner, K&L Gates LLP, Seattle, Washington\n\nC\n\n2027\n\nGovernors and presidents[edit]\nThe position was installed under the title of \"Governor\" until the Banking Act of 1935 abolished the dual role of governor and agent and created a single leadership role \u2013 president.\n\n\n\n#\n\nPortrait\n\nCEO\n\nLife span\n\nTerm start\n\nTerm end\n\nTenure length\n\nRef\n\n\nGovernors\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nArchibald C.

    "content": "\n\nEconomic policy relating to housing markets\nIn the United States, rent control refers to laws or ordinances that set price controls on the rent of residential housing to function as a price ceiling.[1] More loosely, \"rent control\" describes several types of price control:\n\n\"strict price ceilings\", also known as \"rent freeze\" systems, or \"absolute\" or \"first generation\" rent controls, in which no increases in rent are allowed at all (rent is typically frozen at the rate existing when the law was enacted);\n\"vacancy control\", also known as \"strict\" or \"strong\" rent control, in which the rental price can rise but continues to be regulated in between tenancies (a new tenant pays almost the same rent as the previous tenant); and\n\"vacancy decontrol\", also known as \"tenancy\" or \"second-generation\" rent control, which limits price increases during a tenancy but allows rents to rise to market rate between tenancies (new tenants pay market rate rent but increases are limited as long as they remain).[1]\nAs of 2022, seven states (California, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Maine, Oregon, and Minnesota) and the District of Columbia have localities in which some form of residential rent control is in effect (for normal structures, excluding mobile homes).[2]  Thirty-seven states either prohibit or preempt rent control, while seven states allow their cities to enact rent control but have no cities that have implemented it.[3][4]\nThere is a consensus among economists that rent control reduces the quality and quantity of rental housing units.[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12] Other observers see rent control as benefiting the renter, preventing excessive rent increases and unfair evictions. Rent control may stabilize a community, promoting continuity, and it may mitigate income inequality.[13][14][15]\n\n\nHistory\nIn the United States during World War I, rents were \"controlled\" through a combination of public pressure and the efforts of local anti-rent-profiteering committees. Between 1919 and 1924, a number of cities and states adopted rent- and eviction-control laws. Modern rent controls were first adopted in response to the Great Depression and WWII- era shortages. Because of these shortages and the overall national economic crisis, the federal government called for emergency price control on consumer goods and rent control in 1942.[16] However, not all states decided to implement these rent control laws.\nDuring World War II roughly 80% of rental housing was put under rent control starting in 1941.[17] The observed result was that landlords opted to sell their units at uncontrolled prices rather than renting at controlled prices, leading to an increase in home ownership and a decrease in rental units.[17]\nIt was not until the 1970s, during the economic recession, that Richard Nixon temporarily implemented a national wage and price controls to combat inflation, but this did not last for long and began to phase out in 1973. Nonetheless, tenants particularly in Berkeley kept organizing and brought rent stabilization to the June 6, 1973 L972 ballot. They won and Berkeley became the first city in California to have rent control since World War II.[16] Other cities around the country followed and some still remain in effect or have been reintroduced in certain cities with large tenant populations, such as New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Oakland, California. Many smaller communities also have rent control \u2014 notably the California cities of Santa Monica, Berkeley, and West Hollywood[18] \u2014 along with many small towns in New Jersey. In the early 1990s, rent control in some cities, such as Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, was ended by state referendums.[19] When rent control ended in Cambridge, the city realized a 20% increase in new development and an increase in property values, according to a study by the MIT Center for Real Estate.[20]\nHistory reveals that these regulations are constantly in flux and adapting to situations such as natural disasters, economic crises, and pandemics. These changes do not always look the same and vary within each state and city. For example, due to COVID-19, Oakland, California implemented a moratorium to prevent evictions from happening, which ended in February 2021.[21] Whereas in Massachusetts the eviction moratorium ended on October 17, 2020, and there was a CDC moratorium that stopped physical removals in cases where tenants owed rent due to illness or job loss until December 31, 2020.[22]\n\nNew York\nNew York State has had the longest history of rent controls, since 1920.[23][24][25][26] New York City contains the majority of units covered by rent control. Rent control laws have stayed on the books for decades in New York because of an inadequate supply of \"decent, affordable housing\".[27] The worsening in the rental market led to the enactment of the Rent Stabilization Law of 1969, which aimed to help increase the number of available rental units. The current system is very complicated, and most of the protected renters are elderly.[28] William A. Moses, the founder of the Community Housing Improvement Program, a trade association that represents the owners of over 4,000 apartment buildings in New York City, said in 1983 that rent control was \"the principal reason for neighborhood deterioration\" and that at least 300,000 apartment units would have been built in New York City without it. Moses argued that landlords might not maintain their property if they were not allowed to collect adequate rent.[29] Urban planning scholar Peter Marcuse said in 1983 that rent control was not the reason for some landlords abandoning their NYC properties at the low end of the market \u2013 instead, such abandonment stemmed from the inability of low-income renters to pay the maximum rent allowed by law.[29] New York expanded rent control to encompass other municipalities in 2019 through the passage of the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019.[30] Since then, opponents have argued these new rent control regulations hinder investment in multifamily properties in New York City.[31] New York's rent control laws have also received criticism for inadvertently benefiting affluent tenants who might not otherwise need rental assistance.[32] Additionally, a survey of property owners who own or manage rent stabilized units in New York City found that rent regulations would lead to fewer non-essential improvements and proactive maintenance at their buildings.[33]\n\nCalifornia\nIn California, municipal enactment of rent controls followed the high inflation of the 1970s (causing rents to continually rise)[34]:\u200a1\u200a and the 1979 statewide Proposition 13, which set property tax rates at 1%, and capped yearly increases at 2%. Leading the campaign to enact Proposition 13, California politician Howard Jarvis tried to get tenants to vote for Prop 13 by claiming that landlords would pass tax savings along to tenants; when most failed to do so, it became an additional motivating factor for rent control.[34]:\u200a2\u200a\nIn 1985, California adopted the Ellis Act, eliminating municipalities' ability to prohibit the removal of properties from rental activities after the California Supreme Court in Nash v. City of Santa Monica ruled that municipalities could prevent landlords from \"going out of business\" and withdrawing their properties from the rental market.[35]\n\"Strong\" or \"vacancy control\" rent control laws were in effect in five California cities (West Hollywood, Santa Monica, Berkeley, East Palo Alto, and Cotati) in 1995, when AB 1164 (known as the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act) preempted some elements of municipal rent control ordinances and eliminated strong rent-control in California (except in special cases like mobile home parks).[36][37][38]\nIn 2018, a statewide initiative (Proposition 10) attempted to repeal the Costa-Hawkins law, which, if passed, would have allowed cities and municipalities to enact \"strong\" or \"vacancy control\" systems, allowed rent control to be applied to buildings built after 1995, and would have allowed rent control on single-family homes. All are currently prohibited by Costa-Hawkins.[39]:\u200a1\u200a The proposition failed 59% to 41%.[40][41]\nIn 2019, the California legislature passed and the governor signed AB 1482, which created a statewide rent cap for the next 10 years.[42] The Tenant Protection Act of 2019 caps annual rent increases at 5% plus regional inflation.[42] For example, had the bill been in effect in 2019, rent increases in Los Angeles would have been capped at 8.3%, and in San Francisco at 9%.[42] The increases are pegged to the rental rate as of March 15, 2019.[42]  The new law does not apply to buildings built within the prior 15 years, or to single-family homes (unless owned by corporations or institutional investors).[42]   It also includes a requirement to show \"just cause\" for evictions, and retains \"vacancy decontrol\", meaning that rents can increase to market rate between tenants.[42]\nIn 2020, Michael Weinstein, the founder of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF), sponsored and financed a second ballot initiative to allow more rent control, because he felt that AB 1482 (above) did not provide enough tenant protections, such as limiting rent increases between tenants.[42] 2020 California Proposition 21, like its predecessor 2018 California Proposition 10, was funded almost exclusively by Weinstein's AIDS Healthcare Foundation, and failed by an almost identical margin.[42][43][44] AHF is also a supporter of the 'Justice for Renters Act,' a 2024 ballot initiative that would expand local control over rent laws.[45]\n\nMassachusetts\nRent control existed in Massachusetts between 1970 and 1994 when it was repealed by ballot initiative. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the number of rental units was reduced by 15% and tenants were 8-9% less likely to move due to rent control.[46] Tenants paid 40% below market rates on their units, and the value of properties was diminished by 45%.[46]\nDuring its existence, those who lived in rent controlled apartments included Ruth Abrams, a Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, and Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark.[47] It was blamed for the death of at least one landlord, due to the stress caused by a ruling from a rent control board that would require him to raise his entire house to create a new, legal apartment in the basement.[48][49][50]\nAfter the repeal, the Massachusetts General Court passed a law protecting low-income tenants in rent control apartments from being evicted.[51] Only 9.4% of tenants in rent control apartments qualified.[51][52]\n\nOregon\nIn 2019, Oregon's legislature passed a bill which made the state the first in the nation to adopt a state-wide rent control policy. This new law limits annual rent increases to inflation plus 7 percent, includes vacancy decontrol (market rate between tenancies), exempts new construction for 15 years, and keeps the current state ban on local rent control policies (state level preemption) intact.[53]:\u200a1\u200a[54]:\u200a1\u200a\n\nMinnesota\nIn November 2021, voters in Saint Paul, Minnesota, passed a rent control ballot initiative that capped annual rent increases at 3 percent, included vacancy control, and did not exempt new construction or allow inflation to be added to the allowable rate increase.[55][56]  This resulted in an 80% reduction in requests for new housing permits, while in neighboring Minneapolis, where the city council didn't take any action; after the voters authorized the city council to craft a rent control ordinance which might exempt new construction; permits were up 70% in the following months.[55][57] Saint Paul's rent control initiative has been significantly rolled back since then.[58] In September 2022, the Saint Paul City Council voted to amend the law, allowing higher vacancy increases and exempting units built in the preceding or following 20 years from the increase cap.[59][60] Since then, St. Paul's typical rents have grown at a pace similar to that of non-rent controlled Minneapolis in recent years according to Zillow estimates, since the ordinance gives landlords several options to raise rents more than the 3% annual cap.[61]\n\nCities\nFor localities with rent control, it often covers a large percentage of that city's stock of rental units. For example, in New York City as of 2017, 45% of rental units were \"rent stabilized\" and 1% were \"rent controlled\" (these are different legal classifications in NYC).[62] In the District of Columbia as of 2019, about 36% of rental units were rent controlled.[63] In San Francisco as of 2014, about 75% of all rental units were rent controlled,[64]:\u200a1\u200a and in Los Angeles in 2014, 80% of multifamily units were rent controlled.[65]:\u200a1\u200a\n\nMobile homes\nIn some regions, rent control laws are more commonly adopted for mobile home parks.[66]  Reasons given for these laws include residents owning their homes while renting the land the home sits on, the high cost of moving mobile homes, and the loss of home value when they are moved. California, for example, has only 13 local apartment rent control laws but over 100 local mobile home rent control laws.[citation needed]  No new mobile home parks have been built in California since 1991.[citation needed]\n\nLaw\nRent control laws define which rental units are affected, and may only cover larger complexes, or units older than a certain date. To attempt to not disincentivise investment in new housing stock, rent control laws often exempt new construction.  For example, San Francisco's Rent Stabilization Ordinance exempts all units built after 1979.[67] New York State generally exempts units built after 1974 anywhere in the state (although owners can agree to rent stabilization in exchange for tax benefits).[68]\nThe frequency and degree of rent increases are limited, usually to the rate of inflation defined by the United States Consumer Price Index or to a fraction thereof. San Francisco, for example, allows annual rent increases of 60% of the CPI, up to a maximum 7%.[69]\nRent control laws are often administered by nonelected rent control boards. Officers in city government assign members of the board, which will ensure mixed numbers of tenants and property owners to balance out their benefits. As stated in Goodman's research, a typical rent control board in New York is structured by two tenants, two landlords, and one homeowner. (Gilderbloom & Markham, 1996).[70]\n\nFederal law\nRent regulation in the United States is an issue for each state. In 1921, the Supreme Court of the United States case of Block v. Hirsh[71] held by a majority that regulation of rents in the District of Columbia as a temporary emergency measure was constitutional, but shortly afterwards in 1924 in Chastleton Corp v. Sinclair[72] the same law was unanimously struck down by the Supreme Court.  After the 1930s New Deal, the Supreme Court ceased to interfere with social and economic legislation, and a growing number of states adopted rules.[citation needed] In the 1986 case of Fisher v. City of Berkeley,[73] the US Supreme court held that there was no incompatibility between rent control and the Sherman Act.\n\nState and local law\nOregon and California are the only states with statewide rent control laws, both enacted in 2019.[74][42] Six states\u2014California, New York, New Jersey, Maine, Maryland, and Minnesota\u2014have localities in which some form of residential rent control is in effect.[75][76] The District of Columbia also has rent control for some rental units; publicly owned or assisted properties, properties built in 1978 or later, and properties held by an owner with fewer than five rental units are exempt from D.C.'s rent-control law.[77]\nThirty-seven states either prohibit or preempt rent control, while eight states allow their cities to enact rent control, but have no cities that have implemented it.[3][4]\nAs of 2019, about 182 U.S. municipalities had rent control: 99 in New Jersey, 63 in New York, 18 in California, one in Maryland, and Washington, D.C.[75] The five most populous cities with rent control are New York City; Los Angeles; San Francisco; Oakland; and Washington, D.C.[75] The sole Maryland municipality with rent control is Takoma Park.[78] On July 23, 2024, Montgomery County, Maryland adopted a rent stabilization law to limit rent increases to the level of inflation.[79]\nIn 2012, only 2% of economists surveyed believed rent control had a positive impact on New York City and San Francisco; 81 percent disagreed.[46]\n\nImpact\nThere is a consensus among economists that rent control reduces the quality and quantity of housing.[5][80]:\u200a106\u200a[81]:\u200a204\u200a[82]:\u200a1\u200a A 2009 review of the economic literature[80]:\u200a106\u200a by Blair Jenkins found that \"the economics profession has reached a rare consensus: Rent control creates many more problems than it solves\".[80]:\u200a105\u200a[83]:\u200a1\u200a[84]:\u200a1\u200a[85]:\u200a1\u200a\nIn a 2013 analysis of the body of economic research on rent control by Peter Tatian at the Urban Institute (a think tank described both as \"liberal\"[86] and \"independent\"[87][88]), he stated that \"The conclusion seems to be that rent stabilization doesn't do a good job of protecting its intended beneficiaries\u2014poor or vulnerable renters\u2014because the targeting of the benefits is very haphazard.\", and concluded that: \"Given the current research, there seems to be little one can say in favor of rent control.\"[83]:\u200a1\u200a[89]:\u200a1\u200a[90]:\u200a1\u200a\nTwo economists from opposing sides of the political spectrum, Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman (who identifies as an American liberal or European social democrat),[91] and Thomas Sowell, (who stated that \"libertarian\" might best describe his views)[92]:\u200a1\u200a have both criticized rent regulation as poor economics, which, despite its good intentions, leads to the creation of less housing, raises prices, and increases urban blight.[82]:\u200a1\u200a[93]:\u200a4\u200a [92]:\u200a1\u200a Writing in 1946, economists Milton Friedman and George J. Stigler said: \"Rent ceilings, therefore, cause haphazard and arbitrary allocation of space, inefficient use of space, retardation of new construction and indefinite continuance of rent ceilings, or subsidization of new construction and a future depression in residential building.\"[94]\nHistorically, there have been two types of rent control \u2013 vacancy control (where the rent level of a unit is controlled irrespective of whether the tenant remains in the unit or not) and vacancy decontrol (where the rent level is controlled only while the existing tenant remains in the unit). In California prior to 1997, both types were allowed (the Costa/Hawkins bill of that year phased out vacancy control provisions). A 1990 study of Santa Monica, CA showed that vacancy control in that city protected existing tenants (lower increases in rent and longer stability). However, the policy potentially discouraged investors from building new rental units.[95]\nA 2000 study that compared the border areas of four California cities having vacancy control provisions (Santa Monica, Berkeley, West Hollywood, East Palo Alto) with the border areas of adjoining jurisdictions (two of which allowed vacancy decontrol, including Los Angeles, and two of which had no rent control) showed that existing tenants in the vacancy control cities had lower rents and longer tenure than in the comparison areas.  Thus, the ordinances helped protect the existing tenants and, therefore, increased community stability. However, there were fewer new rental units created in the border areas of the vacancy controlled cities over the 10-year period.[96]\nA study that compared the effects of local rent control measures (both vacancy control and vacancy decontrol) with other local growth management measures in 490 California cities and counties (including all the largest ones) showed that rent control was stronger than individual land use restrictions (but not the aggregate effect of all growth restrictions) in reducing the number of rental units constructed between 1980 and 1990.[97] The measures (both rent control and growth management) helped displace new construction from the metropolitan areas to the interiors of the state with low income and minority populations being particularly impacted.\nIn 1994, San Francisco voters passed a ballot initiative which expanded the city's existing rent control laws to include small multi-unit apartments with four or less units, built prior to 1980 (about 30% of the city's rental housing stock at the time).[98]:\u200a7\u200a[99]:\u200a1\u200a[100]:\u200a1\u200a \nIn 2017, Stanford economics researcher Rebecca Diamond and others published a study which examined the effects of this specific rent control law on the rental units newly controlled compared to similar style units (multi-unit apartments with four or less units) not under rent control (built after 1980), as well as this law's effect on the total city rental stock, and on overall rent prices in the city, covering the years from 1995 to 2012.[99][100][101][102]:\u200a1\u200a[103]:\u200a1\u200a[104] They found that while San Francisco's rent control laws benefited tenants who had rent controlled units, it also resulted in landlords removing 30% of the units in the study from the rental market, (by conversion to condos or TICs) which led to a 15% citywide decrease in total rental units, and a 7% increase in citywide rents.[98]:\u200a1,44\u200a[99]\n[100]:\u200a1\u200a[101][102] The authors stated that \"This substitution toward owner occupied and high-end new construction rental housing likely fueled the gentrification of San Francisco, as these types of properties cater to higher income individuals.\"[98]:\u200a3\u200a[99][100]:\u200a1\u200a[101][102][103]:\u200a1\u200a The authors also noted that \"...forcing landlords to provide insurance against rent increases leads to large losses to tenants. If society desires to provide social insurance against rent increases, it would be more desirable to offer this subsidy in the form of a government subsidy or tax credit. This would remove landlords' incentives to decrease the housing supply and could provide households with the insurance they desire.\"[98]:\u200a44\u200a[99]:\u200a1\u200a[100]:\u200a1\u200a[101]:\u200a1\u200a[102]:\u200a1\u200a[103]:\u200a1\u200a[104]:\u200a1\u200a\nThe rental-accommodation market suffers from information asymmetries and high transaction costs. Typically, a landlord has more information about a home than a prospective tenant can reasonably detect. Moreover, once the tenant has moved in, the costs of moving again are very high.  Unscrupulous landlords could conceal defects and, if the tenant complains, threaten to raise the rent at the end of the lease. With rent control, tenants can request that hidden defects, if they exist, be repaired to comply with building code requirements, without fearing retaliatory rent increases. Rent control could thus compensate somewhat for inefficiencies of the housing market.[1]:\u200a1\u200a[105] In older buildings, rent control may broaden incentives to renovate individual units: tenants may invest sweat equity and their own money to improve their homes if they are protected from landlords trying to capture the added value,[106][107][citation needed] while vacancy decontrol preserves landlords' financial incentive to renovate vacant units because it allows them to re-rent at market value.\nAccording to a 2018 review of new research by Rebecca Diamond, new research showed that rent control benefitted tenants in the short-run, but had adverse effects for tenants and neighborhood stability in the long-run by reducing affordability, increasing gentrification, and creating negative spillovers for nearby neighborhoods.[108] Landlords frequently responded to rent control policies by reconverting rentals into buildings exempt from rent control or by allowing rentals to decay.[108]\nA 2019 NBER working paper, which evaluated the efficacy of different housing affordability government policies, found that better targeting of rent control (towards the neediest households) could be welfare improving.[109] A 2021 study modelled rent control policies and found that they may raise housing prices and reduce housing quantities, but that \"well-designed rent control may help policymakers to stabilize housing market dynamics, even without creating housing market distortions\".[110]\n\n\nIn 2000, New York Times columnist and Princeton University economist Paul Krugman published a frequently cited column on rent control.[111] He wrote, \"The analysis of rent control is among the best-understood issues in all of economics, and \u2013 among economists anyway \u2013 one of the least controversial. In 1992, a poll of the American Economic Association found 93 percent of its members agreeing that 'a ceiling on rents reduces the quality and quantity of housing.\"\nIn light of recent legislative activity and ballot initiatives, several editorial boards have weighed in on rent control. In March 2019, the Chicago Tribune noted,[112] \"The cost of rent control would be borne throughout the city in ways that, over time, would leave Chicago worse off. Even for many renters.\" In September 2019, the Washington Post argued,[113] \"Rent-controlled laws can be good for some privileged beneficiaries, who are often not the people who really need help. But they are bad for many others.\" In September 2019, the Wall Street Journal wrote,[114] \"Economists of all stripes agree rent control doesn't work. A mere 2% think it has positive effects, according to a 2012 survey by the IGM Forum.\"\nTenants' rights activists argue that rent control is necessary in times of long term housing shortages (See California housing shortage) to reduce the human suffering caused by increasing rents and the homelessness which results when people who can no longer afford the rent increases get evicted.[115]:\u200a1\u200a Milton Friedman argued that rent control restricts the property rights of property owners,[94] as it limits what they may do with their property, requiring petitioning and other processes by law, prior to taking action against a renter.\n\nSee also\nPeople\n\nDon A.

Conclusion - This paper presents new evidence on the effects of rent control during World War II. The analysis suggests that rent control induced landlords to withdraw their units from the rental stock in order to sell them for owner-occupancy at uncontrolled prices. Two complementary analyses give evidence in support of this hypothesis. First, in a newly compiled dataset on newspaper advertisements from 1939 to 1946, I use variation in the timing of imposition of rent control, and show that cities saw differential increases in the number of sale advertisements at the time of control and for at least several quarters thereafter.\n\n^ \"Appendix 2 - List Of Cities With Rent Control\".

Tomorrow the St. Paul City Council will discuss the details of implementing Question 1, a brief, voter-passed ordinance that caps annual rent increases at 3 percent and which includes none of the typical exemptions or allowances for new construction, vacant units, or inflation. ... California and Oregon policies also include a number of other exemptions to their state-level rent control laws. They allow property owners, up to a point, to add inflation to allowable rent increases. They both allow landlords to raise rents as high as they want between tenants and have higher caps on rent increases: 5 percent in California and 7 percent in Oregon.\n\n^ Galioto, Katie (2021-11-20). \"Fearing a spike, tenant advocates keep a close eye on St. Paul rents\". Star Tribune. More than 30,000 St. Paul residents \u2014 about 53% of voters \u2014 approved an ordinance by referendum earlier this month that will cap annual rent increases at 3%. The city has yet to hammer out the finer points of its new policy, which has been pegged as one of the most stringent rent control measures in the nation because it does not allow landlords to raise rents once a tenant moves out, does not exempt new construction and is not tied to inflation.\n\n^ Callaghan, Peter (2022-03-16). \"Minnesota Senate committee moves bill to retroactively cancel rent control measures passed by voters in Minneapolis, St. Paul\".

As early as the mid-1960s, artists began pioneering the economically-depressed manufacturing zone of lower Manhattan known as SoHo where they found affordable \"raw\" or \"as is\" spaces large enough to both live and work (ie: lofts). Delighted to receive rent for these often abandoned, derelict spaces, commercial property owners welcomed and encouraged the residential occupancy of their buildings. Using sweat equity, artists renovated their leased lofts converting them into habitable living/working studios, installing plumbing and electrical fixtures along with other improvements--generally at their own expense. The City, which was equally delighted by the stabilization of the property tax base, turned a blind eye to the fact that none of these buildings had a residential Certificate of Occupancy.\n\n^ a b Diamond, Rebecca (2018-10-18). \"What does economic evidence tell us about the effects of rent control?\".

    "content": "\nLockouts over time\nEviction lockouts served by county Sheriffs from 2017 to 2021\nPrior to the pandemic, Bay Area counties executed over 6,000 lockouts per year, with over 500 per month. January and July are often particularly busy months for evictions.\nAfter the first eviction moratorium in March 2020, the number of lockouts dropped to almost zero. However, as the pandemic wore on, counts started to increase, with a spike in July 2021. With expiration of the CDC moratorium in late 2021 and loosening of California restrictions in October 2021, eviction counts may rise to pre-pandemic levels in 2022.\nNote: The San Francisco County Sheriff department wasn't able to provide a large amount of their data prior to this release, resulting in a very limited count in their area\u2014we will update these numbers as they come in.\nPandemic lockouts vs. historical average\nMonthly eviction counts compared to pre-pandemic historical averages.\nThe graph above provides insight into how the moratorium affected eviction rates during the pandemic. Bars that extend above the dashed line represent months where rates were higher than the historical average, while bars that do not reach the dashed line represent months where rates were lower than the historical average.\nAs the graph illustrates, right before the start of the pandemic in January 2020, eviction rates were higher than the historical average. After the moratoriums were issued in March 2020, counts quickly fell below historical averages in the following months. In July 2021, however, there was a substantial spike in evictions followed by elevated counts through October 2021 (where our dataset ends). Both January 2020 and July 2021 had historically high eviction rates, although it is unclear why.\nThis graph clearly shows that federal and state funded eviction rental assistance programs had a significant impact in reducing counts during the pandemic. These below-average-numbers are especially surprising given the massive increase in households that found themselves in economically precarious conditions during this time. \nLockouts per 100 people over 5 years\nThe number of lockouts as a share of total renters per county\nThe graph above shows the lockout rate\u2014the percentage of renters that were locked out over the study period\u2014both before and during the pandemic. The blue sections of the bars represent pre-pandemic rates while the red sections represent rates during the pandemic. Combined, these two rates provide the overall lockout rates (represented by the full bars). The counties are ordered left to right by the descending number of renters in the county\u2014Santa Clara County has the most renters while Napa County has the least.\nThe graph reveals that Solano County had the highest lockout rate\u2014 5%, or 5 lockouts for every 100 renters. However, Solano County has fewer than 58,000 renters and ranks third to last among Bay Area counties in terms of renter population. Santa Clara County has the highest renter population (279,110) and the highest number of evictions overall (5,424). Contra Costa County has the highest eviction rate among counties that have over 100,000 renters. \nLockout rates by race\n\n\nThis graph, which shows lockout rates by race and ethnicity, reveals the disproportionate impact evictions have on Black renters in the Bay. Black households face significantly higher eviction rates in all Bay Area counties. In Napa County, eviction rates for Black households are more than three times as high as for any other race or ethnicity group. Asian households consistently are evicted at the lowest rates in all counties.\nBIPOC vs. White lockout rates\n\n",

    "title": "California's AB-1482 Eviction Law | Express Evictions",
    "content": "\nThe California Tenant Protection Act of 2019, popularly referred to as Assembly Bill or AB 1482, is a statewide law signed by Governor Newsome on October 8, 2019.\nAB 1482 took effect on January 1, 2020 and is set to expire on January 1, 2030.\nWhether you\u2019re a landlord or tenant, it\u2019s important for you to know how AB 1482 can potentially affect you by getting in touch with us at Express Evictions. You can also use this as your guide in understanding and mastering the key points in this law.\nHighlights of AB 1482\nAB 1482 is an important California law with the following highlights:\n\nIt requires a landlord to establish just cause to be able to terminate a tenancy.\nIt sets the limit to annual rent increases to no more than 5 percent plus the local consumer price index or CPI (inflation rate), or 10 percent (whichever is lower).\nNo tenant is allowed to waive their rights to these protections. Any agreement to do so by the tenant is void as it runs contrary to public policy.\nAB 1482 is superseded by local eviction and/or rent increase regulations, and it does not remove or replace existing local tenant protections.\n\nAB 1482 Coverage\nAB 1482 is a statewide law that affects all types of housing located in California, except for the following exemption categories:\nUnits exempted from rent cap limitations and \u201cjust cause\u201d eviction regulations\nAB 1482 does not apply to the following unit classifications:\n\nUnits that were built in the last 15 years; however, this applies on a rolling basis. This means that units built on January 1, 2006 were not covered when the law took effect on January 1, 2020, but are covered on and after January 1, 2021.\nUnits already restricted by a deed, regulatory restrictions, or other recorded document which limits their affordability to low or moderate-income households\nDeed-restricted dormitories\nOwner-occupied duplexes (includes accessory dwelling units or ADUs)\nCertain single-family homes and condominiums \u2013 these are only exempt if they are not owned by a corporation, real estate investment trust (REIT) or an LLC with at least one corporate member, and if the landlord notified the tenant that the tenancy is not subject to the \u201cjust cause\u201d and rent increase limitations in writing as specified in Civil Code Sections 1946.2(e)(8)(B)(i) and 1947.12(d)(5)(B)(i).\n\nOwners of exempt properties are required to provide tenants with a specific notice regarding the\u00a0exemption starting July 1, 2020.\nFor tenancies existing before July 1, 2020, said notice may be provided in the rental agreement, but a written notice must be provided by August 1, 2020, or as an addendum to the lease or rental agreement.\nFor tenancies starting or renewed on or after July 1, 2020, said notice must be provided as an addendum to the lease or rental agreement, or as a written notice signed by the tenant, with a copy provided to the tenant.\nUnits that are exempt from the rent cap limitations\nThe rent cap limitations embodied in AB 1482 do not apply to the following:\n\nUnits that are already subject to a local rent control ordinance restricting annual rent increases to an amount less than 5 percent + CPI.\n\nUnits that are exempt from the \u201cjust cause\u201d regulations\nThe \u201cjust cause\u201d regulations embodied in AB 1482 do not apply to the following:\n\nUnits already subject to a local ordinance that requires \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate a tenancy and is more protective than state law\nSingle-family, owner-occupied residences where the owner rents no more than two bedrooms or units (this includes ADUs and junior ADUs)\nHousing accommodation where the tenant shares a bathroom or kitchen facilities with the owner, if the owner lives at the property as their principal residence\nHousing accommodation provided by a nonprofit hospital, church, extended care facility, licensed extended care facility for the elderly, or an adult residential facility\nTransient and tourist hotel occupancy as defined by Civil Code Section 1940(b)\n\nAB 1482 Eviction Provisions\nAB 1482 prohibits evictions and non-renewals of leases without a just cause. However, the provisions of AB 1482 only apply after all tenants have lived in a unit for at least one year, or where at least one tenant has occupied the unit for 2 years.\nNOTE: There are two types of \u201cjust cause\u201d; that is, \u201cAt Fault Just Cause,\u201d and \u201cNo-Fault Just Cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Fault Just Cause\u201d includes the inability or failure to pay rent, criminal activity, assigning the lease or subletting, or the breach of a material term of the lease.\n\u201cNo Fault Just Cause\u201d includes instances where the owner/owner\u2019s family plans to occupy the property, withdraw the property from the rental market or intend to demolish or substantially remodel the property, or comply with a local ordinance or order issued by a government agency.\n\nA landlord cannot terminate a tenancy unless they have one of the allowable \u201cjust cause\u201d reasons, which must be expressly stated in the notice of tenancy termination.\n\nLandlords must give tenants an opportunity to address \u201ccurable lease violations.\u201d Examples of these include keeping a pet when no pets are allowed, not keeping the premises clean and sanitary, and parking in an unauthorized parking area.\nA landlord who wants to convert their rentals into condos or \u201csubstantially\u201d remodel their property is required to provide relocation fees equivalent to one month of rent.\n\nThese provisions do not apply to cities that already have their own local \u201cjust cause\u201d laws, such as San Francisco, Santa Monica, Los Angeles, etc.\nLimits of Rent Increase Under AB 1482\nFor units covered by AB 1482, the annual rent increase is limited to no more than 5 percent plus the percentage change in the cost of living for the area where the property is located, or 10 percent \u2013 whichever is lower.\nNOTE: \u201cPercentage change in the cost of living\u201d refers to the percentage change in the consumer price index (CPI) for all urban consumers for all items for the metropolitan area in which the property is located, as published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. If there is no regional index available, the California Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for all items, as determined by the Department of Industrial Relations, shall apply (www.dir.ca.gov/OPRL/CAPriceIndex.htm).\n\nFor rent increases that take place before August 1 of any calendar year, the percentage change is calculated using the amount published for April (or March, if no amount is published for April) of the immediately preceding calendar year and April (or March) of the year before that.\nFor rent increases that take effect on or after August 1 of any calendar year, the percentage change is calculated using the amount published for April (or March, if no amount is published for April) of that calendar year and April (or March) of the immediately preceding calendar year.\nThe percentage change should be rounded off to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent.\nThere should be no more than two rent increases within a 12-month period, and the combined amount of the rent increase cannot exceed the 5 percent + CPI cap.\nIf the rent increased by more than 5 percent + CPI between March 15, 2019 and January 1, 2020, then on January 1, 2020 the rent must revert back to the rent on March 15, 2019, plus the allowable increase of 5 percent + CPI. Landlords don\u2019t have to return over payments of rent made between March 15, 2019 and January 1, 2020.\nThe sum of the rent paid by subtenants to a master tenant must not exceed the rent charged by the landlord.\nThere is no cap on the initial rent that can be charged for a vacant unit.\n\nSteps to Take in Case of an AB 1482 Violation\nA tenant who suspects their landlord has increased the rent in violation of AB 1482 can contact the Rent Board through their counseling hotline at 415-252-4600 to get information about their rights.\nIf a tenant is of the opinion that a rent increase violates AB 1482 or a state law, they can file a relevant report under the Tenant Protection Act with the Rent Board. The board would then notify the landlord about the tenant\u2019s report and advise the landlord about the relevant law.\nBut since the Rent Board is not a law enforcement agency and does not provide legal advice, hold hearings or dispute settlements in relation to AB 1482, tenant-landlord disagreements concerning this law can only be enforced in state court.\nIf you are in a similar situation or have questions regarding AB 1482, please get in touch with us at Express Evictions. We\u2019ll be happy to help.\n\n \n",

    "content": "\nTenant Protection Act of 2019\nOn October 8, 2019 Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 1482 that will cap annual rent increases throughout the state to 5% plus the percentage change in the cost of living or 10%, whichever is less. The bill also includes just cause eviction protections for tenants in good standing.\nThe bill becomes effective January 1, 2020.\nLink to Assembly Bill 1482: https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1482\n\u00a0\n\nCan rent be increased more than once a year?\n\nProper notice must be issued to the tenant informing them of the rent increase. For tenants on a month to month agreement, living at the property more than 12 months, rents can be increased up to two times within a 12-month period if it does not exceed the state\u2019s rent cap.\n\nHow is the percentage change of cost of living determined?\n\nThe percentage change in the cost of living is determined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\u00a0 It is adjusted every year for the period of April 1 of the year prior to March 31 of the current year. The percentage varies from area to area depending on where the property is located.\n\nWhat if rent was increased after March 2019?\n\nThe bill has retroactive protections that indicate that if rent was increased more than the 5% plus inflation after March 15, 2019, rent would need to be adjusted to the allowable amount once the bill takes effect.\u00a0 No refund will be due to the tenant for rent paid during that period.\n\nWhat type of properties are covered?\n\nProperties older than 15 years, contain at least 2 units and the owner does not occupy one of the units, and properties that are not regulated by local rent control laws must comply.\n\nWhat type of properties are exempt?\n\nSingle family homes, townhouses, owner occupied duplexes and condos except when owned by corporations or Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT), housing that has an agreement to provide subsidies for very low, low or moderate-income.\n\nWho qualifies for eviction protections?\n\nTenants who have resided at the property for 12 months or more or if additional occupants were added and at least one of the tenants have resided at the property for 24 months.\u00a0 If the tenant is given notice to terminate tenancy on a no-fault cause eviction, they qualify for relocation assistance.\n\nWhat is a no-fault cause eviction?\n\nA no-fault cause eviction is when the termination of tenancy is given to the tenant who has not breached the terms of the agreement and the housing providers wants to recover possession of the property.\u00a0 No-fault causes include: intent by the owner or owner-relative to occupy the unit, withdrawal of the rental property from the rental market, intent to demolish or substantially remodel the unit or the owner is complying with the local ordinance, court order, or other government entity resulting in the need to vacate the property.\n\nWhat reasons would a housing provider have to evict a tenant?\n\nJust cause evictions could include reasons such as: nonpayment of rent, breach of the material term of the lease, nuisance, waste, unlawful/criminal activity, refusal to sign a written extension or renewal of the lease, subletting, refusal to allow owner to enter unit, the owner or family is moving into the unit, substantial renovations or removing the property from the rental market.\u00a0 Note: Just-cause provisions become effective after 12 months of tenancy.\n\nHow much is the relocation assistance?\n\nThe relocation fee is equal to one month\u2019s current rent amount or a rent waiver of the last month of tenancy.\u00a0 The notice to terminate tenancy must indicate which of the two options will be given to the tenant.\u00a0 If the housing provider opts for paying the relocation fee, it must be paid within 15 days of issuing the notice to terminate tenancy.\u00a0 If the housing provider fails to comply with the notice, then the notice is void.\n\nWhat if the tenant doesn\u2019t vacate the property after the notice to terminate tenancy expires?\n\nIf the tenant fails to vacate the property, the actual amount of any relocation assistance or rent waiver provided shall be recoverable as damages in an action to recover possession.\n\n",

    "content": "\nCalifornia \u2013 Placer County\n\nI have rented a condo for 16 years. My last fixed-term lease expired in March 2023 and explicitly included an AB 1482 exemption notice. Since then, my tenancy has automatically converted to month-to-month, and my landlord has not reissued the AB 1482 exemption notice.\n\nI was previously informed that, under California's Tenant Protection Act (AB 1482), a landlord must provide tenants with a written exemption notice at the time the lease transitions to month-to-month tenancy, and I was told this notice needs to be provided annually to remain exempt for month-to-month.\n\nDoes the landlord\u2019s failure to reissue the AB 1482 exemption notice upon the transition to month-to-month tenancy mean that my rental now falls under AB 1482\u2019s tenant protections (rent caps and just-cause eviction requirements)?\n\nCan anyone clarify if this exemption notice is legally required to be reissued in my scenario, and if so, does this lapse result in the loss of exemption status? Thanks.\n\u00a0\n\n",

    "content": "UPDATE: AB 1482, an \u2018Anti-Rent Gouging\u2019 Law, Fails California TenantsUpdate, November 8, 2022: A new UC Berkeley Terner Center report says AB 1482 isn\u2019t working for tenants \u2014 and may never work if reforms don\u2019t take place. Despite how the real estate industry frames AB 1482, it\u2019s obviously not one of the most effective anti-rent gouging laws in the country. Far from it. More details at the end of the article.A so-called \u201canti-rent gouging\u201d law championed by state politicians in 2019 has failed to protect California renters. Housing Is A Human Right opposed the legislation, known as AB 1482, three years ago, predicting a seriously bad deal for tenants. Unfortunately, Housing Is A Human Right\u2019s concerns have been proven correct in 2022 as inflation increases.In 2019, the California legislature proposed a supposed anti-rent gouging bill called AB 1482. It established a five percent annual rent cap plus inflation, and landlords were held to a maximum rent hike of 10 percent. Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill into law in October 2019.But the Los Angeles Times pointed out this week that the \u201c10 percent limit applies to only complexes built before 2007 and those not subjected to rent-control restrictions, meaning that landlords of buildings that fall outside those parameters can raise their rents even higher.\u201dThe LA Times added, \u201cAnd because inflation is so high across the board right now, every region in the state meets the requirement for the cap to be set at a 10 percent increase.\u201dNumerous news outlets are reporting that tenants and activists are now fearing the worst: that landlords who fall under AB 1482 will hit tenants with the maximum 10 percent rent hike, with middle- and working-class renters squeezed even more by California\u2019s ongoing housing affordability crisis.For example, if a renter is already paying $2,000 per month to a landlord, a 10 percent increase will add another $200 \u2014 or, put another way, another $2,400 in rent for the year. That\u2019s an enormous amount that poor and middle- and working-class tenants simply cannot afford, which can lead to devastating, life-altering consequences.A recent study by Zillow found that in cities where people spend more than 32 percent of their take-home pay on rent, a spike in homelessness will follow. A 10 percent rent increase, as allowed by California law, will undoubtedly push many middle- and working-class tenants into shelling out more than 32 percent of their paychecks to landlords, causing them to face the possibility of homelessness.In 2019, Housing Is A Human Right publicly opposed AB 1482, noting there were \u201cserious problems with the bill.\u201d We wrote: \u201cThe currently proposed rent cap is significantly higher than what tenants can afford in an era of stagnant wages and severe income inequality. It risks becoming the new floor \u2014 the new normal for rent increases statewide.\u201dHousing Is A Human Right instead urged \u201creal rent control,\u201d not AB 1482. \u201cWe must protect tenants facing the prospect of losing their homes because of skyrocketing rents \u2014 and preserve the pool of affordable, rent-stabilized housing in the long run.\u201dHousing Is A Human Right continues to advocate for strong rent control policies and the end of statewide restrictions on local rent control ordinances. It\u2019s especially needed with the rise of corporate landlords, whose predatory business practices and unfair, excessive rent hikes have contributed mightily to the housing affordability and homelessness crises.UPDATE: In September 2022, UC Berkeley\u2019s Terner Center weighed in on the failures of AB 1482. In the past, the Terner Center has championed wrong-headed policies that helped fuel the housing affordability crisis, but we\u2019re thankful to see them take a much-needed critical look at AB 1482.In a new report, the Terner Center found a number of damning things:Perhaps most important, the think tank noted: \u201cWith no way of determining rates of compliance and no built-in enforcement mechanism, it is not clear how effective AB 1482\u2019s rent protections are;\u201d\u201c60 percent of repeat rental listing posted in the spring of 2022 had an annual price increase above the corresponding rent cap\u201d as laid out by AB 1482. In other words, landlords were charging more than the 10 percent limit;To make AB 1482 more effective, the Terner Center found a serious need for \u201cmore data and transparency about rental prices;\u201d\u201cBecause AB 1482 is so broad in scope, educating and informing both landlords and tenants on how this law applies to them remains challenging;\u201d\u201cFurther development of programs to ensure landlords understand their responsibilities and that tenants are able to enforce their rights is critical to AB 1482\u2019s long-term success;\u201d\u201cThe protections provided in AB 1482 are only effective if landlords comply with the law;\u201d\u201cResearch on other types of tenant protection policies consistently shows that tenants, particularly from vulnerable populations, are at a disadvantage in ensuring their rights are enforced;\u201d\u201cWithout the development of accountability mechanisms, it will be difficult to achieve AB 1482\u2019s goals, even with robust education and outreach efforts.\u201dLike we said, AB 1482 isn\u2019t working. And if the state legislature doesn\u2019t make many reforms, it will never work. To ensure that tenants are protected, we need real rent control in California.Patrick Range McDonald, the author of this article, is the award-winning advocacy journalist for Housing Is A Human Right.",

    "content": "\n\nFacebook  \nTwitter \nLinkedIn\nReddit \nEmail\n\n\n\nWith rising rents and financial strife from the COVID-19 pandemic rippling through U.S. cities, some municipalities are turning to rent regulation as a policy to help tenants stay in their homes.\nVoters in St. Paul, Minnesota, passed one of the nation\u2019s strictest rent regulation measures in early November, capping rent hikes there at 3% annually. Unlike other ordinances, rent regulation in St. Paul is not linked to inflation and new construction is not exempt. The St. Paul ordinance is also unusual in that it applies to all types of rentals in buildings of any age.\nThe law is set to take effect next year, though the city still has to work out the details and some housing developers have told the Minneapolis Star Tribune they will re-evaluate their building plans.\nOther cities are moving in the same direction. Minneapolis also recently paved the way for rent regulation; Santa Ana, California, passed a rent cap ordinance; and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu is on the record as a rent regulation supporter.\nRent control versus rent stabilization\nRent regulation is a blanket term for government intervention in the residential rental market involving either rent control or rent stabilization measures. Rent control generally refers to hard rent caps, limiting the amount a landlord can charge for a protected unit. Rent stabilization allows for yearly rent increases, usually a small percentage of the previous year\u2019s rent.\nEconomists typically think strict rent caps constrain housing supply in the long run. The argument boils down to this: The U.S. needs more housing, not less, and rent control stifles developers\u2019 profit incentive to build. For economists, it\u2019s about how supply and demand affect prices. When it comes to rental housing, supply and demand are out of whack \u2014 there\u2019s more demand than supply. Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored mortgage buyer, estimates the U.S. is short 3.8 million residential units \u2014 apartments or houses for rent or sale. More supply should lead to lower rents, the economists\u2019 argument goes.\n\u201cAdvocates argue that, in some markets, rent control policies are a necessity to ensure affordability, tenant stabilization, and the rights of tenants,\u201d write University of Dayton political science professor Joshua Ambrosius and his co-authors in one of the papers featured below. \u201cCritics, including many economists, free-market supporters, and landlords, counter that these policies \u2014 even in mild forms \u2014 create inefficiencies in the rental housing market and have adverse effects on the quantity and quality of rental housing.\u201d\nResearch focuses on dollars and cents\nEconomists have tended to focus on the quantity, quality and cost of housing when they study rent regulation. From an academic perspective, it can be difficult to study in detail how tenants benefit by being able to stay in their neighborhoods for years.\nThese benefits could include relationships, professional, personal and educational, that develop over time and can promote upward economic mobility. Maybe a tenant in a rent-regulated unit can afford to live close enough to walk their kids to school, or have a short commute to work. Simply put, there are non-monetary benefits that come with housing stability.\nPublic financial data captures monthly rents, property sales and new construction that developers undertake (or don\u2019t) in response to rent regulation. That data can\u2019t quantify the value an individual or family gets from being in a neighborhood for a long time. Such data can be gathered through surveys or interviews with tenants, but qualitative studies can be costly and there are ethical considerations for researchers, such as ensuring confidentiality for subjects. In short, the data that is easily available on tenants and rental buildings is the data that gets studied.\n\u201cEconomists tend to slight the importance tenants attach to security of tenure,\u201d University of California, Riverside economics professor Richard Arnott wrote in 2003.\u00a0 \u201cA housing unit is a tenant\u2019s home. Coming to know her neighbors and the local shops, she will develop at least some sense of community.\u201d\nA brief history of rent regulation in the U.S.\nCalifornia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Oregon offer various forms of rent regulation at the state level, according to the nonprofit National Multifamily Housing Council. There are 25 states that prevent municipalities from enacting rent control.\nRent control emerged in the U.S. after the country entered World War II. \u201cPutting the country on a war footing required massive relocation of labor, with consequent pressure on many local housing markets,\u201d Arnott explains in a 1995 paper. \u201cControls were imposed to ensure affordable housing and to prevent profiteering.\u201d\nAfter the war came a homebuilding boom. By 1950, New York City was the only place that kept wartime rent controls, essentially freezing rent increases. Arnott refers to those measures as first-generation rent control. They form \u201cthe basis for the common opposition to rent control among economists,\u201d according to Arnott.\nMost modern versions of rent regulation emerged in the 1970s, including in Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. These second-generation rent regulations \u201ccommonly permit automatic percentage rent increases related to the rate of inflation,\u201d Arnott writes. \nThey often allow landlords to apply for exemptions \u2014 for example, if they are having trouble with cash flow. The new St. Paul ordinance allows landlords to apply for exemptions for a variety of reasons, including property tax changes and unavoidable maintenance costs.\nThe third generation of rent control, which Arnott explores in the 2003 paper, is called tenancy rent control. This is where rent increases are controlled for a particular tenant, but the base rent can be adjusted for new tenants once the original tenant vacates.\nArnott argues in the 2003 paper that tenancy rent control can be a decent compromise between the need for tenants to achieve housing stability and landlords to make money and invest in building upkeep. For example, when a tenant vacates a unit, the landlord could raise the base rent above market rate to front-load profits, in anticipation of gaining below market rent in later years of the new tenant\u2019s tenure.\nIn a recent non-peer-reviewed policy brief from the New York University Furman Center, Sophie House and her co-authors propose rent regulation measures should focus on preventing egregious rent hikes and include targeted subsidies, such as property tax credits for landlords.\nLocal building regulations and the design of specific rent regulation ordinances will vary. It\u2019s important that journalists understand whether proposed or adopted rent control ordinances look more like first wave or third wave historical rent regulation. And it\u2019s not just rent control that can affect housing supply \u2014 zoning laws on the books in certain jurisdictions can limit the supply of multifamily housing.\nHere are a few takeaways from the papers featured in the research roundup below:\nRent regulation helps tenants stay in their homes, but landlords and developers may respond in the long run by building more expensive housing not subject to rent regulation.Buildings covered by rent regulation may still be subject to investor takeovers aimed at displacing tenants from rent-regulated units.Strict rent controls can depress property values for rent-controlled and nearby market-rate buildings.But less restrictive rent regulation is not associated with lower rates of new housing construction or lower overall property values.\nRead on for more.\n\u2014\nThe research focus: The authors explore whether a 1994 rent control expansion in San Francisco meant tenants were more likely to stay in their homes and in the city.\nBecause rent control was linked to the year a building was built, the law produced a natural experiment, leaving \u201cvery similar buildings and tenants without rent control,\u201d the authors write.\nKey background: Buildings in San Francisco with five or more apartments became subject to rent control in 1979. New construction was exempt \u2014 so were owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units. Over the years, investors would buy those smaller buildings, then sell a portion of building shares to someone living in the building or someone who would move in, making the buildings owner-occupied.\n\u201cThese small multi-family structures made up about 44% of the rental housing stock in 1990, making this a large exemption to the rent control law,\u201d the authors write.\nFor buildings built before 1980, the 1994 law removed this mom-and-pop loophole investors were exploiting.\nThe data: The authors use address history for San Franciscans from 1980 to 2016. This dataset from private firm Infutor includes subsequent addresses of people who left the city and moved somewhere else in the U.S. during those years. They parse renters from buyers using property records from private firm DataQuick, and they track large building investments with permit data from the city planning office. Lastly, they track condo conversions with parcel history data from the city assessor\u2019s office. The authors split renters into two groups: those living in a small multifamily building built between 1900 and 1979 and those in a small multifamily building built between 1980 and 1990.\nThe second group covers a much smaller timeframe, so it includes fewer renters. But, they span many neighborhoods across the city.\nWhat the research says: Tenants in rent-controlled apartments stayed in their homes longer \u2014 they were 10% to 20% more likely to be at their 1994 address 10 years on. They were also less likely to leave San Francisco compared with tenants not living in rent-controlled apartments. Black, Hispanic and Asian tenants in rent-controlled apartments were all more likely to stay in the city relative to white tenants covered by rent control.\n\u201cWe find tenants covered by rent control do place a substantial value on the benefit, as revealed by their choice to remain in their apartments longer than those without rent control,\u201d the authors write.\nBut, because landlords and investors responded to the 1994 law with condo conversions and new construction, rent control \u201cnot only lowered the supply of rental housing in the city, but also shifted the city\u2019s housing supply toward less affordable types of housing that likely cater to the tastes of higher income individuals,\u201d the authors find.\nThe research focus: Benjamin Teresa, an assistant professor of real estate and finance at Virginia Commonwealth University, takes a close look at how investors in 2005 bought the Riverton Houses, a rent-regulated, multifamily housing development in Harlem, New York, to try to profit from rent gaps.\nA rent gap is the difference between rent charged and rent that could be charged in the market if the building owner regularly invested in things like building upgrades and grounds maintenance \u2014 or, if the owner neglected the property.\n\u201cSince 2001 professional investors connected to broader capital markets, such as private equity firms, have purchased tens of thousands of rent-regulated housing units, with some estimates placing investors\u2019 market share at 10% of the total regulated rental housing stock and higher in some neighborhoods,\u201d Teresa writes.\nKey background: The New York City Council in 1994 loosened renter protections through something called vacancy decontrol. If rent on a stabilized unit reached $2,000 per month and the tenant moved out, the landlord could charge market rates thereon. Stabilization permitted landlords to impose only modest rent hikes. The threshold for vacancy decontrol bumped to about $2,700 per month in 2015. State law eliminated vacancy decontrol in 2019. Teresa explores one example of how investors profited from 25 years of vacancy decontrol.\nThe data: Teresa used public data on deed transfers, mortgage agreements and tax records for the Riverton Houses from 2005 to 2014, and the Commercial Mortgage Backed Security prospectus where investors projected the property\u2019s income growth.\nPlus, Teresa interviewed 18 experts in affordable housing, including attorneys who represent tenants and staff members of housing development organizations. He also interviewed five real estate finance experts.\nTeresa focuses on the injection of speculative capital into the rent-stabilized market \u2014 less so on what happened to tenants in the Riverton Houses as a result of that speculation.\nWhat the research says: The rent gap, and the potential for profit, was large for the Riverton Houses. Teresa calculates the average rent-stabilized unit would have taken about three decades to reach the deregulation threshold, where it could then be rented for market rates. The investors noted they would need to achieve market rates faster than that to make their debt payments. They didn\u2019t meet their marks, \u201cthrowing Riverton into foreclosure and a series of new owners,\u201d Teresa writes.\nThe case of the Riverton Houses is ultimately a snapshot of the interplay between profit potential and inner city revitalization that occurred throughout the 1990s and 2000s across the U.S.\nThe potential for high rents in low-rent buildings was \u201cno longer limited to disinvested neighborhoods,\u201d and \u201c\u2018already gentrified\u2019 neighborhoods may experience new cycles of investment because previous reinvestment waves have further increased potential rents,\u201d Teresa finds.\nA caveat: The paper explores one residential development in the nation\u2019s most populous city. The findings are informative, but not necessarily generalizable to other developments in other cities.\nStill, \u201csituating changing rent control law within the realm of privatization, and in this case more specifically the state\u2019s role in expanding the scope for private extraction of urban land rent, connects this case with other examples of privatization that produce new income streams,\u201d Teresa writes, specifically noting similar deregulation laws in San Francisco.\nThe research focus: There is no statewide rent control policy in New Jersey, but municipalities there can enact their own ordinances on rent regulation. The authors explore how 40 years of rent control in the state affect median rents, new construction and overall property values.\n\u201cNew Jersey, a national leader in tenants\u2019 rights since the 1960s, is an excellent case study of the effects of moderate rent controls because so many (over 100) of its municipal governments have adopted these controls,\u201d the authors write. \u201cWhile not completely ideal, New Jersey is the best available laboratory for examining the impacts of rent control.\u201d\nKey background: Rent control ordinances in New Jersey cities arose during the 1970s. More recent rent control policies fall under the second wave of rent control, which tend to be less restrictive than the first wave. New Jersey has a variety of types of municipalities \u2014 cities, boroughs, towns and townships \u2014 but the authors refer to all of them as \u201ccities\u201d for short. Some cities tether allowable rent increases to cost of living calculations, while others allow a specific percentage increase within a range, most commonly between 3% and 4%.\nThe data: Focusing on 2010, the authors identified 87 cities without rent control and 74 cities with rent control, with an average population of 28,800. They use 2010 census data, the most recent available at the time, to parse differences between cities with and without rent control ordinances.\nWhat the research says: Average monthly rents are $63 higher in non-rent control cities \u2014 $1,090 versus $1,027 in cities with rent control. Rent control cities have twice the population, on average, as non-rent control cities. From 2000 to 2010, the authors do not observe any major difference in new construction or changes in property values between rent control and non-rent control cities.\n\u201cRent control cities have, on average, 50% more rental units, 70% more Black residents, and nearly 25% lower median incomes,\u201d the authors write, with rent control cities experiencing greater population growth and lower vacancy rates from 2000 to 2010.\nMedian income, not the presence of rent control, is a stronger predictor of rents, rooms per unit and rent per room. The authors note that recent rent control ordinances in New Jersey often \u201clack the teeth of past approaches that created firm price ceilings.\u201d\nThe research focus: The authors take advantage of a natural experiment occurring in the mid-1990s in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to assess how a strict rent control ordinance there for decades directly and indirectly affected rental prices. Roughly 100,000 people lived in the city at the time.\n\u201cDistinct from the \u2018direct\u2019 effect of decontrol, which by definition operates only on formerly controlled properties, the indirect channel may affect the market value of both decontrolled and never-controlled properties by increasing the desirability of the neighborhoods in which they are located,\u201d the authors write.\nKey background: Certain rentals in Cambridge were subject to strict caps on rent increases from 1970 to 1994. The caps applied to rentals built before 1969 that were not owner-occupied. Rent-controlled units were often about 40% cheaper than non-rent controlled units, and controlled and non-controlled buildings stood side-by-side. A statewide popular vote in 1994 ended rent control by a 51%-to-49% margin, though 60% of Cambridge residents who voted wanted to keep the controls.\nTenants in rent-controlled units tended to have less income than those in market rate units, \u201cthough a significant number of units were also occupied by wealthy professionals,\u201d the authors write.\nThe data: The main data comes from city administrative records on the assessed value of every condo and house in 1994 and 2004, plus information on condo conversions and the prices of every residential property sale from 1988 to 2005. The authors also track demographic changes with a decade of data from the Cambridge city census.\nWhat the research says: Rent-controlled buildings were about half as valuable as market rate properties. After rent decontrol, their values jumped 25% compared with non-rent controlled buildings during the period studied. Market rate buildings also appreciated in value. \u00a0\nResidential property in Cambridge appreciated $7.7 billion from 1994 to 2004. The authors attribute $2 billion of that value increase to rent decontrol. About half of the appreciation came from units that were never controlled. The value of market rate properties was suppressed by the strict rent control ordinance, they find.\nLandlords invested more in their properties after rent decontrol, with the total permitted building improvements jumping from $21 million per year from 1991 to 1994 to $45 million per year from 1995 to 2004.\n\n",

    "content": "\nProviding the Legislature with a clear picture of the state\u2019s budget condition and the fiscal choices it faces is a cornerstone responsibility of the Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office (LAO). Our office\u2019s independent revenue and expenditure estimates are central to fulfilling this role. The first of our estimates for the approaching budget cycle will be presented in our Fiscal Outlook, due to be released next week. The goal of this report is to give the Legislature our independent estimates and analysis of the state\u2019s budget condition as lawmakers begin planning for the 2025-26 budget.\nInevitably, our estimates will differ to some degree from those prepared by the Department of Finance (DOF) and included in the Governor\u2019s budget, released each year in January. Such differences reflect in part the differing roles of our office\u2014serving the Legislature\u2014and the Department of Finance\u2014serving the Governor. While our assessment provides the Legislature a starting point for deliberation, the administration\u2019s assessment integrates the Governor\u2019s proposals. As such, our independent fiscal assessment underlies the Legislature\u2019s ability to assert an informed check on the executive branch, making any added complexity from diverging estimates a worthwhile trade-off.\nEstablishing Baseline Expenditure Estimates: a Key Step in Fiscal Planning\nWhen developing our fall fiscal outlook for the state, we begin by estimating the expenditure baseline. This reflects the projected cost of maintaining current state government programs and services under existing laws and policies, before considering the fiscal effects of any new policy decisions. Our approach can be thought of as forming baseline estimates from behind a political and policy \u201cveil of ignorance,\u201d to borrow a concept from philosopher John Rawls. This approach gives the Legislature at the outset of the budget process a clear assessment of state fiscal resources as it considers its options and the trade-offs of the Governor\u2019s proposals.\nAn independent assessment of the state\u2019s existing spending commitments helps equip the Legislature to consider the full scope of the fiscal choices before it\u2014critical insight for the branch of government with constitutional authority over appropriations. Given that we and DOF operate independently and have different roles in the budget process, our interpretations of \u201ccurrent law and policy\u201d also frequently differ to some degree. These lead to differences in our baseline projections, which in turn lead to differences in our assessments of the state\u2019s fiscal position. Although these differences may seem like budgetary technicalities, they reflect the differing purposes and roles of our offices. The value we aim to offer the Legislature is an impartial analysis of the state\u2019s fiscal position so the Legislature can weigh its options, and those proposed by the Governor, with a clear view.\nIndependent Revenue Estimates Are Important to the Legislature\u2019s Coequal Status\nEstimated revenues are another frequent source of difference between our office and DOF. Some have asked why this is the case and whether aligning LAO and DOF estimates would be helpful to the Legislature. Although aligning revenue estimates might reduce the potential for confusion, doing so would risk creating bigger problems. In particular, it could provide a false sense of certainty about the state\u2019s fiscal position. This, in turn, could prevent the Legislature from grappling with the important risks and trade-offs inherent in their budgeting decisions. Our independent revenue estimates facilitate consideration of these trade-offs in several ways.\nFirst, given the importance of revenues to the state\u2019s overall spending capacity, our nonpartisan independent revenue estimates provide the Legislature with an alternative, credible basis for budget decisions that may diverge from the Governor\u2019s proposal. Our process also aims to promote the Legislature\u2019s consideration of its own risk tolerance. To this end, in recent years, we have shifted away from emphasizing point forecasts in favor of providing a plausible revenue range. Our approach does not preclude the Legislature from using our forecast to adopt a specific revenue estimate, however. For instance, the Legislature could adopt our main (median) revenue forecast from the range. Our main forecast presents estimates that we think are \u201cmost likely to be least wrong.\u201d That is, we estimate that the main forecast is equally as likely to be above or below actual revenue outcomes. Reflecting the ever-changing economic backdrop, the high-and-low points in the range, as well as the upside and downside risks to the main forecast, will vary from year to year.\nSecond, even if the Legislature most often adopts the administration\u2019s revenue estimates in the budget, the alternative LAO numbers facilitate valuable deliberations. The administration\u2019s revenue estimates flow from the specific economic scenario that it deems most likely to unfold. But since macroeconomic dynamics are multifaceted and context dependent, successfully predicting the scenario that will play out is virtually impossible. Consider as evidence that in just the last several years\u2014during and after the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014consensus macroeconomic forecasts have been wildly off from actual outcomes. But adopting a budget requires a specific revenue estimate, so what to do? Here, the LAO and DOF approaches can complement one another. For example, the Legislature can compare DOF revenue estimates to our main forecast to determine if it is comfortable with the risks associated with them. If the DOF revenue estimate is above our main forecast, this would suggest we estimate that it carries greater downside risk, and vice versa. Given the uncertainty of these forecasts, deliberation over the budget assumption is healthy and appropriate. Our approach reflects that, in part, we believe humility is always an important virtue in fiscal and revenue forecasting.\nFinally\u2014and briefly\u2014while numerous states employ various consensus revenue estimating methods, the research is ambiguous as to whether they yield more accurate results. There is even evidence to suggest that drawing upon forecasts from multiple sources can improve accuracy, assuming the forecasts themselves are developed independently.\nThese trade-offs speak to the Legislature\u2019s status as a coequal branch of government. A nonpartisan and independent assessment of the state\u2019s fiscal trajectory, developed on its behalf, ensures the Legislature has a credible basis for making its own budget decisions. The added complexity from the alternative revenue estimates making this possible is a worthwhile price to pay.\nReaffirming the LAO\u2019s Independent Mandate\nThe LAO was established in 1941 because the Legislature sought an independent source of information and analysis\u2014one directly accountable to it and serving as a fiscal watchdog on its behalf. Although such an office was unprecedented at the time, the LAO\u2019s existence inspired the creation of similar offices in state governments across the country and, eventually, the Congressional Budget Office in 1974. The office\u2019s independence remains as crucial as ever for fostering informed debate, ensuring transparency, and upholding the integrity of the state\u2019s budget process. While differences between LAO and DOF estimates may sometimes add inconvenient complexity, they embody vital safeguards that ensure diverse perspectives are rigorously considered in shaping California\u2019s financial future. Our purpose is not to align with the executive branch but to provide the Legislature with the independent, critical analysis it needs to make informed decisions that best serve the public interest.\n\n",

In determining the lowest gross rental amount pursuant to this section, any rent discounts, incentives, concessions, or credits offered by the owner of such unit of residential real property and accepted by the tenant shall be excluded.

    "title": "California AB-1482: Rent Control & Eviction Protections Explained - LegalClarity",
    "content": "\nCalifornia Assembly Bill 1482, enacted in 2019, is a significant effort to address housing affordability and tenant stability. This law aims to control rent increases and provide eviction protections across the state. With California\u2019s housing crisis intensifying, understanding AB-1482 is crucial for tenants, landlords, and policymakers.\n\nRent Increase Limitations\nAB-1482 limits annual rent increases to 5% plus the local rate of inflation, up to a maximum of 10%. This cap provides tenants with predictable rent changes, easing financial strain from sudden hikes. The law applies to most rental properties built before January 1, 2005.\nRent increases are linked to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), ensuring they align with economic conditions. Landlords must provide written notice of rent increases, adhering to statutory limits and timelines.\n\nJust Cause Eviction Protections\nAB-1482 introduces just cause eviction protections, enhancing tenant security by limiting eviction grounds. Landlords must provide a valid reason, either \u201cat-fault\u201d or \u201cno-fault,\u201d for evicting tenants who have resided in a property for 12 months or more. At-fault reasons include non-payment of rent, lease breaches, criminal activity, or causing a nuisance. These measures prevent arbitrary evictions and promote tenant stability.\nNo-fault evictions cover situations like the landlord or family occupying the unit, withdrawing the property from the market, or substantial renovations. In such cases, landlords typically provide relocation assistance, equivalent to one month\u2019s rent, to ease the tenant\u2019s transition.\n\nExemptions and Exceptions\nAB-1482 includes exemptions and exceptions that limit its applicability. Single-family homes and condominiums are exempt from the rent cap and eviction protections if the owner is not a real estate trust, corporation, or LLC with a corporate member. Landlords must notify tenants in writing about the property\u2019s exempt status.\nHousing built within the last 15 years is exempt, encouraging new construction by allowing developers to set initial rents freely. Properties under local rent control ordinances offering equal or greater tenant protections than AB-1482 are also exempt.\n\nCompliance and Enforcement\nCompliance with AB-1482 requires landlords and tenants to understand their rights and responsibilities. Landlords must provide proper notice for rent increases and evictions, maintaining documentation to demonstrate compliance. Tenants should be aware of their protections to assert their rights effectively.\nEnforcement of AB-1482 largely depends on tenants initiating action if they suspect violations. Tenants can seek remedies through local housing courts, often with assistance from legal aid organizations and tenant advocacy groups.\n\n\n",

tenant could continue living in the residential real property without violating health, safety, and habitability codes and laws.

    "content": "(1)\u00a0Existing law declares that it is the policy of the state that no adoptable animal should be euthanized if it can be adopted into a suitable home. Existing law also declares that it is the policy of the state that no treatable animal should be euthanized.This bill, Bowie\u2019s Law, would require an animal shelter, as defined, to provide in a conspicuous location on its internet website or a third-party internet website a list of all animals that are available for adoption or that are being held pursuant to specified laws, except as provided. The bill would also require the Department of Food and Agriculture to conduct a study on certain topics, including, among other topics, the overcrowding of California\u2019s animal shelters, and, on or before January 1, 2028, to submit a report on that study to the Legislature, as\n\t\t\t provided. The bill would repeal these study and reporting requirements on January 1, 2032.To the extent that this bill would impose a new program or higher level of service on local public animal control agencies or shelters, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.(2)\u00a0The existing Polanco-Lockyer Pet Breeder Warranty Act requires every breeder of dogs to meet certain requirements relating to housing and maintaining dogs and to disclose specified information. The act defines \u201cdog breeder\u201d and \u201cbreeder\u201d to mean a person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other association that has sold, transferred, or given away all or part of 3 or more litters or 20 or more dogs during the preceding 12 months that were bred and reared on the premises of the person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other association.This bill would change that definition to\n\t\t\t a person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other association that has sold, transferred, or given away all or part of 2 or more litters or 10 or more dogs during the preceding 12 months, as specified. The bill would additionally require a breeder, before a dog reaches eight weeks of age, to have a microchip device implanted in the dog that identifies the breeder, except as provided. The bill would require the breeder, upon the sale or transfer of the dog, to register the identity of the new owner with the microchip registry company as the primary owner on the microchip device and would require the breeder to provide certain information to the new owner regarding the microchip. The bill would prohibit a dog from being sold or otherwise transferred by a breeder, whether for compensation or otherwise, until it has been immunized against common diseases\n\t\t\t diseases, in accordance with veterinary recommendations for the age and breed of the dog, and has a documented health check from a licensed California-licensed veterinarian.(3)\u00a0The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.",

    "title": "California limits when a landlord can evict renters. | Legal Services of Northern California",
    "content": "The Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB 1482) requires a landlord to have a valid reason to evict renters so long as the renter has lived in the rental housing for at least 12 months. This is called \u201cjust cause\u201d protections for eviction.\u00a0What are the reasons a landlord can evict a renter?For any renter who is protected by the law, the landlord can only evict for one of the \u201cat fault\u201d or \u201cno fault\u201d reasons listed in the law. \u201cAt fault\u201d means your landlord says you have done something wrong. Some of the \u201cat-fault\u201d reasons listed in the law are:Not paying your rent.Breaking a material rule in your lease or rental agreement.Criminal activity at the rental housing.Subletting if your lease does not allow this.Refusing to sign a new lease, if the new lease offers similar terms to your old lease.Denying your landlord entry into your home, if the landlord has a legal right to enter.\u00a0\u201cNo-fault\u201d means you have not done anything wrong. But, your landlord can still require you to move out for one of the \u201cno-fault\u201d reasons listed in the law. If your landlord evicts you for one of these reasons, they must first give you one month\u2019s rent or waive one month\u2019s rent to help you move out.\u00a0What notice does the landlord have to provide me?A landlord who evicts you for either an \u201cat fault\u201d or \u201cno fault\u201d reason, must first give you a written notice that states the reason.\u00a0Does the law apply to me?The law applies throughout California. It protects many renters in California, but not all. The just cause protections apply to renters who live in certain types of housing once they have lived in the housing for 12 months. If any adult tenant moves into the rental housing before you have lived there for 12 months, the just cause protections do not apply until you have lived there for 24 months or all adult tenants have lived in the rental housing for 12 months, whichever comes first.\u00a0Does the law apply to the housing I live in?The just cause protections apply to renters who live in:Most apartment buildings that were built at least 15 years ago.Duplexes that were built at least 15 years ago - if the owner does not live in the other side.Single family houses that were built at least 15 years ago that are owned by a corporation.The law does not apply to some renters, including those who live in:Housing that was built less than 15 years ago;Some single family homes owned by individuals (if the landlord provided an exemption notice); andSome types of Low-Income Housing, where the rents are kept lower by a deed or regulatory agreement. (Note: this does not include renters with a Section 8 voucher.)This is not a complete list of who the law protects and who it does not apply to. Contact our local office to get more information about whether the law applies to you.\n",

    "content": "California Rental Market Report\nAlthough\u00a0Florida\u00a0and\u00a0Texas\u00a0may boast better weather and beaches than\u00a0California, this state remains a magnet for newcomers of all kinds.\nWith a population of around 40 million, it\u2019s a massive marketplace of homes, buildings, property, people and opportunities nestled in a diversified economy of farming, tourism, and technology.\n\nAnd every year, hopeful property investors wonder if the\u00a0California rental market\u00a0is investible. Although a large number of single-family homes have been taken off the market in the last few years, it remains one of the top states for rental real estate investors.\n\nBut is it one for small business landlords and multifamily investors? Or is the encroachment of corporate multifamily investment firms going to bring a greater competitive challenge?\nThe overall\u00a0California housing market\u00a0presents complex challenges and opportunities for small landlords wishing to grow their portfolios.\nNo other state offers the mix of rental property assets to invest in as California does. As you\u2019ll read, the market\u2019s local flavor and makeup makes it less desirable to large international corporate landlords who might wish to push small landlords out of the picture. Small landlords armed with top management tools and advisors are well-positioned to continue succeeding in the Golden State.\nA Place of Small Business Landlords\nStats show California is dominated by small landlords, single-family houses and low-rise properties.\u00a0 California landlords have been here a long time and have developed sophisticated investing and management strategies. And that\u2019s due to a more challenging environment where talent in property investing and management is needed. Many will use the latest\u00a0SaaS property management software\u00a0to protect their margins, earnings, tenants and asset values while others will depend on a competent\u00a0California property management company.\nFor renters, California\u2019s country-leading\u00a0rent prices\u00a0make living here a challenge. Although incomes are rising, rents continue their upward trend and the state\u2019s faltering government is raising taxes to cover massive debt loads and tax shortfalls. It\u2019s pressure-on for renters here and for landlords to beware if they\u2019re not screening tenants well.\nThe business challenge for landlords and tenants is obvious, but investors in the state still prefer it to investing elsewhere. You\u2019ll be looking for the\u00a0best types of rentals\u00a0in the\u00a0best California cities\u00a0for sure, but you\u2019ll be digging in to find gems in smaller cities with upside potential.\nRent Prices Overall\nAccording to\u00a0Property Chomp,\u00a0the median gross rents paid per month in California are:\n\nStudio: $1,698 (+10% YoY)\n1-Bedroom: $2,395 (+7% YoY)\n2-Bedroom: $3,190 (+7% YoY)\n3-Bedroom: $4,378 (+4% YoY)\n4-Bedroom: $5,925 (no change)\n\nCalifornia was once an owner-occupied state but has quickly become a renter state (49% renter-occupied). With home prices at US leading levels and mortgage rates remaining well above 6%, the outlook for\u00a0lower rent prices\u00a0seems dim. While there has been a large exodus of workers and homeowners to other states such as Arizona, Colorado,\u00a0Florida,\u00a0Texas\u00a0and\u00a0Tennessee, the state still attracts massive numbers of newcomers, many of them immigrants. That increases demand for homes and rentals making it seem like a no-brainer for landlords.\n\n\n\nZumper Price Report\n1 Bedroom Rentals\n2 Bedroom Rentals\n\n\nPrice\nPrice\nMonthly Change\nYearly Change\nPrice\nMonthly Change\n\n\n\n\nSanta Ana, CA\n$2,180\n-0.90%\n-0.90%\n$2,810\n-5.70%\n0.40%\n\n\nSan Jose, CA\n$2,450\n0.80%\n-3.20%\n$3,090\n-1.00%\n-2.20%\n\n\nSan Francisco, CA\n$2,950\n1.00%\n0.00%\n$3,920\n0.00%\n-0.80%\n\n\nSan Diego, CA\n$2,330\n-0.90%\n-0.90%\n$3,140\n-0.60%\n4.30%\n\n\nSacramento, CA\n$1,530\n0.70%\n0.70%\n$1,890\n2.20%\n2.70%\n\n\nOakland, CA\n$2,050\n-1.40%\n-6.80%\n$2,700\n0.70%\n-2.50%\n\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n$2,390\n1.70%\n0.00%\n$3,330\n-0.60%\n4.40%\n\n\nLong Beach, CA\n$1,800\n0.00%\n0.00%\n$2,400\n0.00%\n4.30%\n\n\nFresno, CA\n$1,360\n4.60%\n1.50%\n$1,600\n0.60%\n2.60%\n\n\nBakersfield, CA\n$1,050\n-0.90%\n-5.40%\n$1,350\n-3.60%\n-2.90%\n\n\nAnaheim, CA\n$2,020\n2.00%\n1.00%\n$2,580\n-0.40%\n0.80%\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe opportunity and variety of rental properties are endless, but the state is subject to rent controls, and tough landlord regulations, and the stressed cap rates and high financing costs require owners to be excellent money and property managers.\nAnyone who invests in the\u00a0California housing market\u00a0must be a savvy real estate investor, and ready to discover and learn the truth about properties here. And being tech savvy is expected given this is the technology state.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that for tech workers, California is the ideal place to be whether it\u2019s Los Angeles, San Diego or the Silicon Valley regions. And high paid tech workers drive the rental market which is why cities like San Francisco, San Jose, Oakland, San Diego and Los Angeles have such high rent prices.\nQuestions for California Rental Investors\nFor California property investors, the question becomes about whether cap rates here are sufficient and whether\u00a0occupancy rates\u00a0and rent prices might rise in the next 5 years. California\u2019s state government is in debt distress seeking Federal bailout money in the billions. But with tax hikes on the horizon, does buying rentals in California make any sense vs\u00a0Florida rentals,\u00a0Texas rentals\u00a0or North Carolina Rentals?\nIt\u2019s a fantastic market with continuous demand from endless tourists visiting and from never-say-residents who just love the Golden State. Despite high rent prices, California homeowners and business owners refuse to leave the home they love. That bodes well for you as a landlord, that demand is persistent and renters are loyal, if not stuck. You might say they may never solve the housing crisis in California. The more homes are built, the more newcomers are attracted.\nIt\u2019s not just the allure of the Golden Gate Bridge, Silicon Valley tech, golden sand beaches, wineries, theme parks, vibrant cities, Yosemite Park, surfing big waves in So Cal, palm trees, unbeatable sunsets, and a perfect climate. It\u2019s that all that and more which command a higher rent price.\nRent prices climbed in 2021/2022 but that pace is definitely over.\nThe key question perhaps for US and International investors is whether California will remain a\u00a0good place to buy real estate\u00a0over the next 5 years. Will taxes smother landlords and will rent price controls put them out of business? How severe is the single-family and housing shortage and when will the recent glut of multifamily construction releases be absorbed? Are the prices too high and what is the ROI like?\nWe\u2019ll explore that here in the\u00a0California Rental Market Report.\nBrief Overview of the California Rental Market\nA report just published in the San Diego Tribune by JONATHAN LANSNER shows only about a quarter of all California renters live in big apartment complexes. Those with 20 or more units comprised about 1.65 million households. He found via census data that 2.1 million households are in smaller buildings of 2 to 19 units. Single-family houses comprised 2 million households which is about 34% of renters in the state. And 128,000 households live in mobile homes, RVs and boats.\nLarge apartment buildings simply haven\u2019t taken off in the Golden State, and houses and small buildings dominate the California rental market.\nRent Prices in California vs Florida or Texas\nRent prices in California like most states are high and forecasts are to the upside for 2024/2025. The USC Casden Forecast predicts rents will rise 2% to 3.5% annually in Southern California over the next two years.\nDemand and Price Drivers\nKey factors in the rental housing market in California are:\n\nrising debt maturities for real estate investors and refinancing at higher rates in 2024/2025\nexodus of young renters to Texas, Arizona, Washington, Nevada and Oregon\nrising population with immigration at a high\nnew multifamily housing unit permits dropping\nrents fell $200 on average over last 12 months (Zillow)\nlow supply should push grow rent prices again\nseveral new taxes on property transactions over $5 million\nresidents leaving metro Los Angeles (net loss 146,000)\nvacancy rate forecast to stay just about 4.8% until end of 2025\npayroll growth slow markedly to 0.3% in 2024 from 2.1% in 2023 (Comerica report)\nsingle family construction expected to lead the residential market\njob growth slowed considerably in 2nd half 2023 (Calmatters.org)\nbudget deficit, flat tax revenue and massive unemployment insurance debt are financial headaches with no quick political cures (Calmatters.org)\n\nCap Rates in California Cities\nAverage Cap Rates by City\u00a0(via CapRateindex.com)\nLos Angeles \u2013 4.8San Diego \u2014 4.44San Francisco \u2014 4.97San Jose \u2014\u00a0 5.05Sacramento \u2014 6.19Oakland \u2014\u00a0 6.04San Bernardino \u2014 5.92Oceanside \u2014 4.81Napa \u2014\u00a0 5.66Fresno \u2014 6.44Monterey \u2014 5.56San Mateo \u2014 4.55Miami, FL \u2014 6.84Nashville \u2014 6.24Dallas TX \u2014 6.55Las Vegas \u2014 6.22\nInflation is Easing in California\nIf inflation was driving the misery index, reducing supply, and flattening the\u00a0housing market, 2024 could be a turnaround year.

    "content": "\n26 Sep AB 1482 \u2013 What Does It Mean for California?\n\nPosted at 18:29h\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin AB 1482, MW Blog Posts \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJeremy Raglin\n\n\n\nIt\u2018s been a few weeks now since it was announced that AB 1482 has officially passed the State Senate, becoming law in California, but the big question is now that it\u2019s passed what does this bill really mean for California?\nIn this article, we will provide you with more information about AB 1482 and insight into how this rent control bill will affect the rental market in the Golden State.\nAbout AB 1482 \nAfter months of contentious negotiations between landlord and tenant groups, our elected officials in California finally reached an agreement on the specific language of AB 1482. This anti rent gouging bill will include the following:\n\nCaps rent increases at 5 percent plus the consumer price index\nDoes not prevent deregulation of vacant units. \nCities cannot implement rent hike caps lower than 5 percent\u00a0\nThe 10-year sunset clause creates certainty for multifamily investors and lenders.\nLimits rent hikes on units that are at least 15 years old\nOwners who share a home with their tenants or owner-occupied duplexes would be exempt from the caps.\u00a0\nKeeps Costa Hawkins in place, at least for now\u2026\nExpires automatically in 2030\n\nControversial \nAlthough AB 1482 was supported at the last minute by the California Apartment Association (CAA), this bill was opposed by the California Association of Realtors (CAR).\nWill AB 1482 be bad for California? That depends on whom you ask.\nThe reality with the housing crisis in California is that this rent control bill doesn\u2019t do anything to encourage the construction of more housing in the state and until that problem is solved California\u2019s housing crisis will always be a supply vs. demand problem.\nSadly, in spite of California now having \u201cde facto\u201d rent control in the state, many tenants rights groups statewide feel that the bill doesn\u2019t do enough to protect tenants and they are supporting tougher rent control measures statewide like Proposition 10, which was voted down by voters last year.\nContact MW Real Estate Group\nTo learn more about rent control in California, or to speak with us about our property management services, contact us today by calling (213) 927-2117 or click here to connect with us online.\n\n",

Moreover, ten states do not impose rent regulations, having no reference to the policy in state or local laws. \u00a0\nOregon and Washington have rent control statewide but preempt it locally. Eight more states plus the District of Columbia have rent control policies in place at the state or local level.

    "title": "California's 2020 Tenant Protection Act: AB 1482",
    "content": "Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 1482 on Oct. 8, 2019, enacting statewide rent control legislation in California, which will take effect on Jan. 1, 2020.1\u00a0Below is a summary of select key provisions.\n1. ANNUAL CAP ON RENT INCREASES EXPLAINED\nAB 1482 Caps Annual Rent Increases at 5% Plus Inflation. Effective Jan. 1, 2020, AB 1482 caps rent increases statewide at 5% plus local inflation per year for the next 10 years, unless lawmakers vote to extend it.\n\n\nIf you live in a city\u00a0that does not already have a local rent control law, rent increases will be limited to 5%, plus local inflation, but can never exceed a total of 10%.\n\n\nFor example, if the inflation rate is 3.8%, a landlord could raise rent by as much as 8.8%. If the inflation rate is 6%, a landlord could only raise rent by as much as 10%.\n\n\n\n\nThe rate of inflation will be tied to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in each metropolitan area. (The CPI increases about 2-3% each per year.)\n\n\nAB 1482 is retroactive to March 15, 2019. Whatever amount a tenant paid as of that date is the amount by which the increase will be based.\n\n\nRent may not be increased more than twice over a 12-month period (total sum of such increases not to exceed the annual rent cap).\n\n\n2. JURISDICTIONS WITH LOCAL RENT CONTROL\nAB 1482 Does Not Override Local Rent Control Rules. AB 1482 does not apply to housing regulated by local rent control ordinances and the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act. Cities and counties can continue to pass local rent control laws consistent with Costa-Hawkins and set rent caps at any level they choose; however, they cannot affect the buildings and associated rent cap that fall under AB 1482.\n\n\nCosta-Hawkins prevents cities from establishing rent control \u2013 or capping rent \u2013 on apartment units constructed\u00a0after\u00a0Feb. 1, 1995.2\n\n\nAB 1482 leaves in place existing local government rent control ordinances on pre-1995 units.\n\n\nConsistent with Costa-Hawkins, local governments would still be prohibited from imposing rent control, which is stricter than AB 1482 rent caps, on post-1995 units.\n\n\n\n\nIn jurisdictions with local rent control laws, AB 1482 will apply only to housing that both: (1) qualifies for the AB 1482 annual rent cap;\u00a0and\u00a0(2) is not otherwise covered by local rent control.3\n\n\nIn the city of Los Angeles, the local rent control law only applies to buildings constructed before October 1978.\n\n\nFor buildings constructed\u00a0before\u00a0October 1978, rent will be capped under the provisions of the city\u2019s law (i.e., 4% in 2019).\n\n\nFor buildings constructed\u00a0after\u00a0October 1978 and that are at least fifteen (15) years old (1978-2005), rent will be capped at 5%, plus inflation under AB 1482.\n\n\nBuildings constructed\u00a0after\u00a02005 will have no rent cap until they turn fifteen (15) years old and qualify for AB 1482.\n\n\n\n\nIn San Francisco, the city\u2019s rent control ordinance will continue to cover multifamily housing constructed before June 1979.\n\n\nFor buildings constructed before June 1979, rent will be capped under the provisions of the city\u2019s law.\n\n\nFor buildings constructed after June 1979 and that are at least fifteen (15) years old (1979-2005), rent will be capped at 5%, plus inflation under AB 1482.\n\n\nBuildings constructed after 2005 will have no rent cap until they turn fifteen (15) years old and qualify for AB 1482.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. BUILDINGS IMPACTED\nAB 1482 Applies to Apartments and Other Multi-Family Buildings Containing Two Units or More. AB 1482 exempts single-family homes and condos, except when owned by a corporation, real estate investment trust, or limited liability corporation in which at least one member is a corporation.4\u00a0AB 1482 also exempts duplexes, when one of the units is occupied by the owner.\u00a0\n4. VACANCY DECONTROL\nAB 1482 Does Not Apply to Vacant Units. AB 1482\u00a0does not\u00a0apply to vacant units. Owners can continue to reset rents to market rate at vacancy, and then resume conforming to the annual cap of 5% plus inflation under AB 1482.\n5. JUST CAUSE EVICTIONS\nAB 1482 Prohibits Evictions Without Just Cause. For tenants that have lived in a unit for at least one year, AB 1482 prohibits evictions and non-renewals of leases without \u201cjust cause.\u201d\n\n\nThere are two types of \u201cjust cause\u201d: (1) \u201cAt Fault Just Cause,\u201d and (2) \u201cNo-Fault Just Cause.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAt Fault Just Cause\u201d includes failure to pay rent, criminal activity, or breach of a material term of the lease.\n\n\n\u201cNo Fault Just Cause\u201d includes if the owner/owner\u2019s family intends to occupy the property, withdrawing the property from the rental market or an intent to demolish or substantially remodel the property, or compliance with a local ordinance or order issued by a governmental agency.\n\n\n\n\nLandlords must give the renter an opportunity to cure \u201ccurable lease violations.\u201d\n\n\nIf a landlord desires to convert the rentals to condos or \u201csubstantially\u201d remodel the property, they will have to pay relocation fees equal to one month of rent.\n\n\nThese rules will not apply to cities with their own local \u201cjust cause\u201d laws (e.g., San Francisco, Santa Monica, Los Angeles [via recent emergency moratorium]).\n\n\n\n1 See final bill here:\u00a0https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1482\n2\u00a0Per Costa-Hawkins, the City of Los Angeles is prohibited from extending rent control to apartments built after October 1978, and San Francisco is prohibited from extending rent control to apartments built after June 1979, which represent the dates when those cities implemented their local rent control ordinance. Cities that didn\u2019t have existing rent control laws in place at the time of the 1995 Costa-Hawkins Act are barred from implementing controls on units built after Feb. 1, 1995.\n3 Jurisdictions with rent control include the city of Los Angeles, Unincorporated Los Angeles County, Beverly Hills, Culver City, West Hollywood, Inglewood, Santa Monica, Berkeley, Campbell, East Palo Alto, Fremont, Hayward, Los Gatos, Oakland, Palm Springs, San Francisco, San Jose, and Thousand Oaks. (Not an exhaustive list.)\n4 Residential dwellings/units that can be sold separately from other units (e.g., condos) are not subject to rent control under AB 1482 provided that: (1) the owner is not a REIT, corporation, or LLC in which at least one member is a corporation; and (2) the tenants have been provided written notice of the same using the following statement: \u201cThis property is not subject to the rent limits imposed by Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code and is not subject to the just cause requirements of Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code. This property meets the requirements of Sections 1947.12 (d)(5) and 1946.2 (e)(8) of the Civil Code and the owner is not any of the following: (1) a real estate investment trust, as defined by Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code; (2) a corporation; or (3) a limited liability company in which at least one member is a corporation.\u201d\n5\u00a0Based on the date a certificate of occupancy was issued for the new building.\n\n",

    "title": "The Impact of Rent Control Expansion in San Francisco on Evictions and Wrongful Claims | National Low Income Housing Coalition",
    "content": "\nA recent study published in the Journal of Housing Economics, \u201cRational eviction: How landlords use evictions in response to rent control\u201d examines the impact of expanding rent control in San Francisco on eviction notices and complaints about wrongful evictions. Rent control policies aim to prevent rapid rent increases and maintain rents below market rates to keep renters more stably housed. As of 2022, several states and over 200 municipalities have adopted some form of rent regulation, while other localities have moved to repeal, weaken, or ban these policies. The study found a substantial increase in no-fault eviction notices and wrongful evictions in San Francisco following expansion of their rent control policy in 1994, especially in lower-income areas and during periods when rent control provisions were more binding. This suggests that rent control may be less effective at promoting housing stability when not paired with stronger tenant protections.\u00a0\u00a0Because rent control policies prevent landlords from raising rents for current tenants to market rates, they tend to reduce returns for landlords and create incentives for them to exit the rental market, reducing the total number of rental units available. To mitigate this exit incentive, some rent control policies incorporate \u201cvacancy decontrol\u201d provisions, allowing landlords to reset rents to market rates upon tenant turnover. However, this allows landlords to benefit financially from turnover and may incentivize them to encourage or force tenants to leave. In the context of 1990s San Francisco, the implementation of rent control and vacancy decontrol provisions were further complicated by policies that limit the legal reasons landlords could evict a tenant. In 1994, a ballot referendum removed exemptions from San Francisco\u2019s existing rent control laws for small (fewer than 5 units), owner-occupied buildings built before 1980, increasing the share of rent-controlled units by roughly 68% per ZIP code on average.\u00a0While prior research has explored how landlords respond to rent control measures by exiting the rental market, the study authors sought to understand how San Francisco landlords adjusted their behavior following the 1994 referendum without exiting the market. They hypothesized that evictions would rise in newly rent-controlled buildings, that there would be larger increases in evictions during periods of high market rent pressure, and more eviction activity in neighborhoods where tenant challenges are less likely.\u00a0The authors used ZIP code-level data on eviction notices and wrongful eviction claims filed in the years before and after the 1994 rent control expansion from the San Francisco Rent Board. To identify where the policy change had the greatest effect, they relied on the 1999 San Francisco Assessor\u2019s Secure Housing Roll, which includes information on unit location, size, and construction year. Buildings with fewer than five units built in 1979 or earlier were considered \"newly rent controlled,\" aligning with the policy change that removed the rent control exemption for such buildings. To address the lag between the 1994 policy and 1999 data, the authors also used building permits and parcel split data.\u00a0Descriptive analyses showed that ZIP codes with more newly rent-controlled units saw sharp increases in wrongful eviction claims beginning in 1996. By contrast, neighborhoods with fewer affected units showed no such trends. Evictions spiked during periods of high rent inflation (1995\u20132005), when market rents far exceeded allowable rent increases, creating stronger incentives for landlords to pursue tenant turnover. The authors note that evictions for reasons \u201clandlords cannot directly control,\u201d such as nuisance and non-payment of rent, remained relatively constant after 1994, while those for reasons such as owner move-in or breach of lease increased.\u00a0The authors constructed a model to examine the differential impacts of rent control expansion on evictions and wrongful eviction claims across San Francisco ZIP codes. They found that for every additional 1000 newly rent-controlled apartments in a ZIP code, there were approximately 20.07 additional eviction notices filed annually. Wrongful eviction claims rose by 7.63 per 1,000 units, a 125% increase. This represents an 83% increase over the pre-referendum average eviction rate. Focusing specifically on newly rent-controlled units (those with two to four units built before 1980), the study finds 16.88 eviction notices per 1000 newly rent-controlled buildings, indicating that the effects are primarily driven by these properties. Effects were concentrated in low-income neighborhoods and were stronger during periods with larger differences between market rents and allowed increases under rent control. These patterns suggest that landlords were more likely to pursue evictions in areas where tenants had fewer resources to challenge them.\u00a0The findings raise concerns about vacancy decontrol provisions in rent control policies can incentivize landlord behaviors that undermine the anti-displacement goals of rent control, resulting in increased housing instability for renters. To address these issues, the authors suggest policies such as tenant anti-harassment ordinances, expanded legal protections, and improved code enforcement. Ensuring access to legal counsel or enabling tenants\u2019 attorneys to recover legal fees could provide additional protection, particularly for low-income renters facing eviction in an already constrained housing market.\u00a0This article can be found at: https://bit.ly/3RsKRrg.\u00a0\n\n",

    "title": "Report Suggests Rent Stabilization Is Associated with Higher Supply of Rental Housing Units Affordable to ELI Renters | National Low Income Housing Coalition",
    "content": "\nA recent report by the Urban Institute, Rent Control and the Supply of Affordable Housing, examines the relationship between rent regulation reforms and the supply of rental housing overall and across varying levels of affordability. While older forms of rent control involved imposing a ceiling on rents for protected units, many modern rent regulation reforms \u2013 known as \u201crent stabilization\u201d measures \u2013 regulate annual rent increases and are accompanied by exceptions related to factors such as vacancy, hardship, and building characteristics. The report\u2019s authors find that rent stabilization reforms are associated with reductions in the overall number of rental units within cities but increases in the number of units affordable to the lowest-income renters. While rent stabilization may be a useful tool to increase the supply of deeply affordable housing in the short term, more research is needed to understand its long-term effects.\nThe researchers developed two datasets to examine the relationship between rent stabilization reforms and housing supply. First, the authors used machine learning to analyze newspaper articles from over 7,000 news outlets covering news stories on rent stabilization reforms across 27 metro areas between 2000 and 2021 to create a cross-city panel of nine metropolitan areas where rent stabilization reforms were enacted. The authors then relied on census microdata from the Federal Statistical Research Data Center (RDC) to create a dataset of rental housing units affordable at different levels of area median income (AMI) for each metro area over the study period.\nAnalyzing the relationship between the implementation of rent stabilization reforms and subsequent changes in housing supply, the researchers found that rent stabilization was associated with a 9.9% reduction in the overall supply of rental housing. That reduction, however, was driven by a 38% reduction in the number of rental units affordable to renter households with incomes above 120% of AMI. At the same time, the researchers found that rent stabilization reforms were associated with a 42.1% increase in the number of units affordable to extremely low-income renters (renter households with incomes at or below 30% of AMI).\u00a0\nThe researchers conclude that rent stabilization reforms may increase affordability for renters with the lowest incomes, though longer-term impacts remain unclear. They call for more research to understand the effects of rent stabilization over time, hypothesizing that decreases in overall supply could negatively impact the lowest-income renters in the long term. If higher-income renters begin to occupy rental units affordable to lower-income renters, for example, lower-income renters will have fewer affordable and available units from which to choose. The authors suggest that rent stabilization policies involve trade-offs and call for additional research to understand which rent stabilization measures best balance the need to increase affordability with the need to preserve the rental housing stock.\nRead the report at: https://bit.ly/47fKSWy\n\n",

    "title": "Landlord-Tenant Issues | State of California - Department of Justice - Office of the Attorney General",
    "content": "As a tenant, knowing your rights is critical. Under California law, residential tenants are protected from certain rent increases and may be protected from certain types of evictions.\nIt is important to act quickly if your landlord serves you with an eviction notice, tells you to move out, increases your rent illegally, or if you know cannot afford your rent. Many legal processes affecting tenants move swiftly, so do not ignore important notices. Instead, reach out for legal assistance as soon as possible to discuss your options. If you cannot afford a lawyer, you may qualify for free or low-cost legal aid. To find a legal aid office near where you live, please visit www.LawHelpCA.org.\nAs a landlord, it is vital to understand and uphold the protections available to California renters under the law. With the recently enacted Tenant Protection Act (AB 1482) and other laws, it is important for landlords of residential properties to be familiar with state and local developments to prevent legal violations.\nClick on the links below to learn more about landlord-tenant protections:\n\n  \nTo stay informed about what the Attorney General is doing to protect tenants\u2019 rights and address California\u2019s housing crisis, please visit the Housing Justice Team webpage at https://oag.ca.gov/housing. For additional resources, visit the State of California\u2019s Housing is Key website, and read the \u201cGuide to Residential Tenants\u2019 and Landlords Rights and Responsibilities.\u201d For residents and owners of mobilehome parks, read the \u201cMobilehome Residency Law Handbook.\u201d \nStatewide Rent Caps and Eviction Protections\nIn 2019, California enacted the Tenant Protection Act (AB 1482), which created significant new protections for residential tenants. Both tenants and landlords should be aware of the requirements of this law.\nLimits on Rent Increases\nThe Tenant Protection Act caps rent increases for most residential tenants in California. Landlords cannot raise rent more than 10% total or 5% plus the percentage change in the cost of living \u2013 whichever is lower \u2013 over a 12-month period. If the tenants of a unit move out and new tenants move in, the landlord may establish the initial rent to charge. (Civ. Code \u00a7 1947.12.) The percentage change in the cost of living for most areas can be found through the national consumer price index by the Bureau of Labor Statistics or California consumer price index by the California Department of Industrial Relations.\nIn addition to the statewide limit, local rent control laws may further restrict how much a landlord can increase rent annually. Tenants and landlords should consult local resources to see whether their city or county has rules that may offer additional protection to tenants.\nJust-Cause Eviction Requirement\nThe Tenant Protection Act also creates statewide eviction protections for most residential tenants after they have lived in their unit for 12 months. The law sets out two kinds of permissible evictions: \"at fault\" evictions (where the landlord moves to evict a tenant because the tenant is allegedly \u201cat fault\u201d) and \"no fault\" evictions (where the landlord moves to evict the tenant through \u201cno fault\u201d of the tenant).\n\u201cAt fault\u201d evictions include:\n  \nNonpayment of rent\nBreach of a material term of the lease\nNuisance, waste, or using the unit for unlawful purposes\nCriminal activity committed on the premises or criminal activity that is directed at the owner or its agent\nRefusal to allow lawful entry\nRefusal to execute a new lease containing similar terms\n\n\u201cNo fault\u201d evictions include:\n  \nOwner move-in\nIntent to demolish or substantially remodel the unit\nWithdrawal of the unit from the rental market\nThe owner complying with a government order or local law that requires the tenant to leave\n\nLandlords can only evict a tenant for one of the reasons listed above. Some of these reasons have their own specific requirements. For instance:\n  \nOwner Move-In: A tenant can only be evicted for owner move-in if the owner or the owner\u2019s spouse, domestic partner, child, grandchild, parent, or grandparent intends to move into the unit. Any landlord planning an owner move-in must act truthfully and in good faith and comply with all state and local requirements. Effective April 1, 2024, the owner or relative must move in within 90 days after the tenant leaves and live there as their primary residence for at least 12 consecutive months. Otherwise, the unit must be offered back to the tenant at the same rent and lease terms as when the tenant left, and the tenant must be reimbursed reasonable moving expenses. Also effective April 1, 2024, the eviction notice must include the name of the person moving in, their relationship to the owner, and that the tenant may request proof of that relationship, and there must be no other similar unit already vacant on the property that the owner or relative could move in to instead.\nSubstantial Remodel: Landlords must act truthfully and in good faith and comply with all state and local requirements when evicting a tenant to conduct a substantial remodel of a unit, as not all repairs meet the definition of \u201csubstantial remodel.\u201d To be a \u201csubstantial remodel,\u201d the landlord must plan to either replace or substantially modify a structural, electrical, plumbing or other system in the unit in a way that requires a permit, or to abate hazardous materials within the unit. In addition, the work must not be able to be done in a safe manner with tenants in the unit and must require a tenant to vacate the unit for at least 30 consecutive days. Cosmetic renovations do not count. Please also be aware that there may be special protections for protected groups such as senior tenants. Effective April 1, 2024, the eviction notice must include a description of the work to be done, copies of required permits, and a notice that if the substantial remodel is not commenced or completed, the tenant must be given the opportunity to re-rent the unit at the same rent and lease terms as when the tenant left.\n\n(Civ. Code \u00a7 1946.2.)\nLying about the reason for evicting a tenant is illegal, and tenants with concerns about the legitimacy of their eviction should consult an attorney.\nIn addition to the statewide requirement that landlords have just cause before evicting a tenant, local laws may offer additional protections to residential tenants. Tenants and landlords should consult local resources to see whether their city or county has rules that may offer additional tenant protections.\nFor more information about evictions, including what to do if you get an eviction notice, see the Know Your Rights \u2013 Eviction Process guide.\nWho These Protections Apply To\nThe Tenant Protection Act applies to ALL residential rental units in the state  except those specifically identified in the law. Some examples of properties not covered by the Act include:\n  \nSingle-family homes not owned or controlled by a corporation or real estate investment trust (the Act does apply to single-family homes owned or controlled by a corporation or real estate investment trust)\nUnits covered by a local rent control ordinance that is more protective than the Tenant Protection Act\nUnits issued a certificate of occupancy within the past 15 years (this is a rolling timeline, so tenants will gain protection once their building turns 15)\nMobilehomes, unless the mobilehome is owned and offered for rent by the owner or manager of a mobilehome park\nDuplexes where the owner is living in one of the units at the time the tenant moves into the other unit, but only as long as the owner continues to live there\nHousing that is restricted as affordable housing by deed, government agency agreement, or other recorded document, or that is subject to an agreement that provides housing subsidies for affordable housing\nDorms\n\nThe Tenant Protection Act applies to recipients of Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. It includes a narrow exception for housing that is restricted as affordable housing by deed, government agency agreement, or other recorded document, or that is subject to an agreement that provides housing subsidies for affordable housing.  (Civ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1946.2, subd. (e)(9), 1947.12, subd. (d)(1).)  Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers help tenants pay for market-rate housing that owners/operators offer to the general public at market-rate rents, not for affordable housing as referenced in the Act. Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers also apply to specific tenancies, not to the housing itself. Market-rate tenancies subsidized by Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers are therefore not exempt from the Act\u2019s rent increase and just cause eviction protections.\nAdditional Topics Affecting Landlords & Tenants\nLandlords and those who act on their behalf, such as property managers, realtors, and attorneys, are responsible for complying with all state and local laws, including the following important points. Tenants should also read the below so they understand their rights as renters.\nHousing Conditions\nLandlords are required to keep residential units safe and well-maintained. This is known as habitability. This includes things like providing safe and working plumbing, heating, electrical equipment, floors, and stairs; effective waterproofing; windows and doors with working locks; and keeping the property free from roaches, rats, and other vermin. (Civil Code \u00a7 1941.1.) Even if tenants knew that their unit was not up to these standards when they moved in, it is still the landlord's responsibility to make all units habitable. Additionally: \n  \nTenants with health or safety issues in their homes have a right to ask their landlords to make repairs. Tenants should make repair requests and complaints about unsafe or unhealthy conditions in writing. Tenants should document issues by text messages, emails, letters, and certified mail, and also by videos and photos. Tenants should keep a copy of any communications they have with their landlord.\nIf a landlord refuses to make repairs, tenants should contact their local code enforcement office or local health department. Cities or counties may also have their own rent board or rent control program that deals with building health and safety.\nIf a tenant living in a unit with health or safety issues is served with an eviction notice, it is very important for the tenant to inform a lawyer or the court about those health and safety issues. Doing so may help the tenant\u2019s defense or affect the landlord\u2019s right to evict the tenant. (Civ. Code \u00a7\u00a7 1942.3, 1942.4.)\nTenants are responsible for keeping their units clean and sanitary, and for using appliances and fixtures as intended. Tenants must also avoid damaging the unit. If tenants cause damage to the unit, they may be responsible for the costs of repairing it.\n\nFor more information about habitability protections, see the Know Your Rights \u2013 Habitability guide.\nNotice for Rent Increases\nWhen raising a tenant\u2019s rent, landlords must deliver the tenant a formal written notice of the change. It is not enough for a landlord to call, text, or email that they plan on raising the rent. Landlords must also give residential tenants sufficient warning before increasing rent. If the rent increase is 10% or less, landlords must provide notice 30 days before the increase can take effect. If the rent increase is more than 10%, the landlord must provide notice 90 days before it can take effect. (Civ. Code \u00a7 827). If a notice is not in writing or delivered on time, a tenant should consult a lawyer about their rights.\n\u201cLockouts\u201d\nIt is illegal to try to \"evict\" a tenant by locking them out, shutting off the water or electricity, or removing their personal property. The only lawful way to evict a tenant is to file a case in court and go through the legal process. A tenant who has been locked out should consult a lawyer about their rights, including returning to their unit and getting damages from the landlord. (Civ. Code \u00a7 789.3.)\nSecurity Deposits\nA security deposit, which some landlords call a \u201cpet deposit,\u201d \u201cmove-in fee,\u201d \u201ccleaning fee,\u201d \u201cdamage deposit,\u201d or other term, is money that a landlord can hold during a tenancy. For most residential rental properties, landlords may only charge a security deposit of up to one month\u2019s rent. Landlords may only use security deposits for unpaid rent, repair of damage caused by the tenant beyond normal wear and tear, cleaning the property so it is as clean as when the tenant moved in, and replacing or restoring the landlord\u2019s furniture or other personal property if authorized by the rental agreement. Within 21 days of the tenant moving out, the landlord must return the security deposit, except for amounts deducted for these lawful purposes, and provide an itemized statement.\nFor more information about security deposits, see the Know Your Rights \u2013 Security Deposits guide.\nPrice Gouging\nPrice-gouging protections, including protections under city or county price gouging ordinances and as a result of local emergency proclamations, may apply to rental housing, effectively limiting rent increases. Many cities and counties have enacted additional rental protections, including rent stabilization and just-cause eviction ordinances that may apply to both rental units and/or to mobilehome owners renting lot spaces from a mobilehome park owner. Landlords and mobilehome park owners should remain aware of the legal requirements applicable to the cities and counties where their rental properties are located.\nRetaliation\nLandlords may not retaliate against tenants for exercising their rights. For example, it is against the law for a landlord to try to evict a tenant who has asked for repairs or pointed out that a rent increase is unlawful, or to take away services or rights that the tenant previously enjoyed, like a storage space or parking. (Civ. Code \u00a7 1942.5.) \nReasonable Accommodations\nResidential landlords must provide reasonable accommodations that will allow tenants with disabilities the full use and enjoyment of their unit. Specifically:\n  \nReasonable accommodations may involve adjusting rules or policies in a way that helps a person with a disability have equal enjoyment of their housing. For example, a landlord is permitted to have a \u201cno pets\u201d policy, but must make a reasonable accommodation for a tenant with a service or emotional support animal by waiving the \u201cno pets\u201d policy for that tenant.\nLandlords cannot charge tenants the cost of offering a reasonable accommodation.\nAdditionally, landlords must make or allow reasonable physical modifications to the unit or common areas so that tenants with disabilities have full enjoyment of the premises. In most situations, tenants are responsible for covering the costs of the reasonable modification.\nIf a tenant with a disability is being denied or charged for a reasonable accommodation, they should contact an attorney.\n\nDiscrimination\nLandlords are prohibited from discriminating against tenants based on the tenant\u2019s race, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender expression, gender identity, ancestry, disability status, marital status, familial status, source of income (Section 8 vouchers, for example), veteran status, or certain other characteristics.\n\nAdditionally, private housing providers are prohibited from discriminating against tenants on the basis of citizenship, immigration status, primary language, age, medical condition, or any other arbitrary personal characteristic.\nDiscrimination may take many different forms, but can include refusing to rent to a certain tenant, providing a tenant with less favorable rental terms, targeting certain tenants for eviction, or more.\nIn most cases, landlords are not allowed to ask a tenant or prospective tenant their immigration or citizenship status. Landlords are never allowed to threaten to disclose a tenant or occupant\u2019s immigration status in order to pressure a tenant to move out. Landlords are also never allowed to harass or retaliate against a tenant by disclosing their immigration status to law enforcement.\nIf you believe you are being discriminated against on the basis for a protected characteristic, you should consult a lawyer. You can also file a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department.\n\nGetting Legal Help\nIf you are a tenant facing an eviction, struggling to pay rent, or otherwise concerned about your ability to stay in your unit, free or low-cost legal help may be available. If you are sued or get an eviction notice, don\u2019t ignore it\u2014act quickly to get help from a lawyer. To find a legal aid office near where you live, please visit www.LawHelpCA.org. If you don\u2019t qualify for legal aid, you may obtain a referral to a certified lawyer referral service from the California State Bar. Members of the armed forces and their dependents can also get legal assistance from their local JAG legal assistance office. If you are unable to find legal assistance, consult the California Courts' self-help resources for tenants facing evictions.\nKnow Your Rights Guides for Tenants\nLocal Rent Stabilization Laws\nQuick Reference Guide for Landlords and Property Managers\n",

    "title": "Attorney General Bonta Announces Largest CCPA Settlement to Date, Secures $1.55 Million from Healthline.com | State of California - Department of Justice - Office of the Attorney General",
    "content": "Action represents fourth settlement, continued enforcement priority under the\u00a0California Consumer Privacy Act\nOAKLAND\u00a0\u2014 California Attorney\u00a0General Rob Bonta today announced a settlement pending court approval\u00a0with website publisher\u00a0Healthline\u00a0Media LLC (Healthline), resolving allegations that its use of online tracking technology on its health information website,\u00a0Healthline.com, violated the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). An investigation by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) found that Healthline\u00a0failed to allow consumers to\u00a0opt out\u00a0of targeted advertising and shared data with third parties without CCPA-mandated privacy protections \u2014 including data suggesting that a person may have a serious health condition. The proposed settlement, pending final approval from the court,\u00a0includes $1.55 million in civil penalties and strong injunctive terms, including a novel\u00a0term that prohibits\u00a0Healthline\u00a0from sharing article titles that reveal that a consumer may have already been diagnosed with a medical condition \u2014 banning the company from engaging in these types of data transmissions.\n\u201cOur settlement\u00a0with\u00a0Healthline\u00a0underscores that Californians have\u00a0critical privacy rights under the CCPA\u00a0to fight online surveillance \u2014 including by website publishers.\u00a0Healthline\u00a0shared data with third parties that could have revealed consumers\u2019 private medical diagnoses, and while doing so, disregarded consumer\u2019s rights to opt-out of the sale and sharing of this data,\u201d\u00a0said Attorney General Bonta.\u00a0\u201cCalifornia continues to lead the nation in enforcing our robust privacy protection law, and businesses that collect consumer data must honor consumers\u2019 privacy rights. My office is committed to the continued enforcement of the CCPA \u2014 every Californian has the right to their online privacy.\u201d\u00a0\nHealthline.com is a health and wellness information website that is one of the top 40 most visited websites in the world.\u00a0Healthline generates revenue by showing ads \u2014 some of which are personally targeted at the reader. To maximize ad revenue,\u00a0Healthline\u00a0allows online trackers, like cookies and pixels, to communicate data about readers to advertisers and other third parties.\u00a0Healthline shared data that could uniquely identify the consumer, in addition to the title of the article they were reading. Some titles indicated that the reader may have already been diagnosed with a serious illness, such as \u201cYou\u2019ve Been Newly Diagnosed with MS. What\u2019s Next?\u201d And because these online trackers run invisibly in the background in the first milliseconds when a webpage loads, consumers often have no idea how many online trackers might be running. In\u00a0Healthline\u2019s case, dozens of trackers were sharing consumer data with numerous third parties.\nThe complaint filed today alleges\u00a0Healthline\u00a0violated the CCPA and the Unfair Competition Law by:\n\nFailing to opt consumers out of the sharing of their personal information for targeted advertising.\u00a0The CCPA gives consumers the right to\u00a0opt-out\u00a0of the sale or sharing of their personal information for certain targeted advertising. Businesses and website publishers\u00a0must honor these requests, including requests submitted through the\u00a0Global Privacy Control. Healthline\u00a0continued to share data with some third parties involved in advertising, even for consumer who exercised their right to opt -out. \u00a0\n\n\nViolating the Purpose Limitation Principle.\u00a0Under\u00a0the CCPA, a business\u2019s use of personal information is limited\u00a0to\u00a0the purposes for which the personal information was collected or processed or another disclosed, compatible purpose.\u00a0Healthline\u00a0violated this principle by sharing article titles suggesting a consumer may have already been diagnosed with a specific medical condition to target advertising at the consumer. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nFailing to maintain CCPA-required contracts.\u00a0Healthline had not ensured its advertising contracts contain privacy protections for readers\u2019 data required by the CCPA. Instead,\u00a0Healthline\u00a0had assumed, but not verified, that the third parties had agreed to abide by an industry contractual framework.\u00a0\n\n\nDeceiving consumers about privacy practices.\u00a0The Unfair Competition Law prohibits deceptive business practices.\u00a0Healthline.com featured a \u201cconsent banner\u201d that did not disable tracking cookies, despite purporting to do so if a consumer unchecked a box. \u00a0\u00a0\n\nUnder the settlement today,\u00a0Healthline\u00a0is required to ensure that its opt-out mechanisms work correctly; must stop disclosing information that can link a specific consumer to a specific article title that suggests that consumers have been diagnosed with a disease; must maintain a CCPA compliance program that, among other things, mandates that\u00a0Healthline\u00a0audits its contracts for specific, required privacy terms or confirm that third parties have signed an industry contractual framework that includes those terms; and maintain accurate online disclosures and privacy policy.\u00a0\nToday's settlement represents Attorney General Bonta's\u00a0fourth\u00a0enforcement action under\u00a0the CCPA, and his continued priority to enforce California\u2019s robust privacy laws: \u00a0\nIn June\u00a02024, Attorney General Bonta and Los Angeles City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto announced a $500,000 settlement with Tilting Point Media LLC resolving allegations that the company violated the CCPA and federal law by collecting and sharing children\u2019s data without parental consent in their popular mobile app game \u201cSpongeBob: Krusty Cook-Off.\u201d \u00a0In February 2024, Attorney General Bonta\u00a0announced\u00a0a settlement\u00a0with DoorDash, resolving allegations that the company violated the CCPA and COPPA, by selling\u00a0California customers\u2019 personal information without providing notice or an opportunity to opt out of that sale.\u00a0 In August 2022, the Attorney General\u00a0announced\u00a0a settlement with Sephora resolving allegations that it failed to disclose to consumers that it was selling their personal information and failed to process opt-out requests via user-enabled global privacy controls in violation of the CCPA.\u00a0\nThis March, as part of ongoing efforts to enforce the CCPA, Attorney General Bonta\u00a0announced an investigative sweep into the\u00a0location data industry, sending letters to advertising networks, mobile app providers, and data brokers\u00a0that appear to be in violation of the CCPA. The risk posed by the widespread collection and sale of location data has become immediately and particularly relevant given federal threats to California's\u00a0immigrant communities, and to\u00a0reproductive and gender-affirming\u00a0healthcare.\u00a0Attorney General Bonta has previously conducted investigative sweeps related to\u00a0streaming apps and devices\u00a0and\u00a0employee information.\nFor more information about the CCPA, visit\u00a0oag.ca.gov/ccpa.

    "content": "Tilting Point Media LLC\nTilting Point Media LLC, in a stipulated judgment, agreed to pay $500,000 to resolve allegations that the mobile video game developer collected and shared children\u2019s data without obtaining parental consent, in violation of the California Consumer Privacy Act and the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act. Our joint investigation with the Los Angeles City Attorney\u2019s Office revealed that in connection with Tilting Point\u2019s popular mobile app game \u201cSpongeBob: Krusty Cook-Off,\u201d which is directed to children under the age of 13 as well as targeted to older teens and adults, Titling Point\u2019s age screen did not ask age in a neutral manner, meaning children were not encouraged to enter their age correctly to be directed to a child-version of the game. Tilting Point also inadvertently misconfigured third-party software development kits (SDKs), resulting in the collection and sale of kid\u2019s data without parental consent. The settlement requires Tilting Point to take significant steps to prevent future improper collection and sale of children\u2019s data and improper advertising to children in connection with all of its games directed to children, including: using only neutral age screens that encourage children to enter their age accurately; not selling or sharing the personal information of consumers less than 13 years old without parental consent, and not selling or sharing the personal information of consumers at least 13 and less than 16 years old without the consumer\u2019s affirmative \u201copt-in\u201d consent; minimizing data collection and use from children; complying with laws and best practices related to advertising to minors; and implementing and maintaining a SDK governance framework to review the use and configuration of SDKs within its apps.\n\n\nBlackbaud\nBlackbaud, Inc., in a stipulated judgment, agreed to pay $6.75 million to resolved allegations that it violated consumer protection and privacy laws arising from a 2020 data breach.  In connection with their use of Blackbaud\u2019s products and services, these non-profit organizations store, among other things, names, Social Security numbers, bank account information, and medical information of California residents in Blackbaud\u2019s databases.  Blackbaud\u2019s failure to implement reasonable data security\u2014such as failing to ensure that old backup databases had been delete and implementing multi-factor authentication\u2014allowed a threat actor to steal consumers\u2019 personal information.  Blackbaud then made misleading statements regarding the sufficiency of its data security efforts prior to the breach, and misleading statements about the extent of the breach to its non-profit customers and the public.  The Consumer Protection Section-Privacy Unit and Healthcare Rights & Access Section investigated jointly.  The settlement also requires Blackbaud to improve its security to safeguard personal and protected health information.\n\n\nDoorDash\nDoorDash, Inc., in a stipulated judgment, agreed to pay $375,000 to resolve allegations that the food delivery platform had sold the personal information of its customers without providing notice or the opportunity to opt-out, in violation of the California Consumer Privacy Act and the California Online Privacy Protection Act. The sale occurred in connection with DoorDash\u2019s participation in marketing co-operatives, where businesses contribute the personal information of their customers in exchange for the opportunity to advertise their products to each other\u2019s customers. The investigation found that DoorDash customer data was subsequently disclosed to businesses that were not participants of the marketing co-operatives, including to a data broker that re-sold the customer data many times over. The settlement required DoorDash to take significant steps to prevent future unlawful misconduct, including reviewing contracts with marketing and analytics vendors, using technology to evaluate if the company is selling or sharing consumer personal information, and providing annual reports monitoring any potential sale or sharing of consumer personal information.\nGoogle\nGoogle, LLC in a stipulated judgment, agreed to pay $93 million to resolve allegations that the technology company\u2019s location-privacy practices violated California consumer protection laws.  The multi-year investigation determined Google was deceiving users by collecting, storing, and using their location data for consumer profiling and advertising purposes without consent.  The settlement required Google to take significant steps to prevent future unlawful misconduct, including showing additional information to users when enabling location-related account settings, providing more transparency about its location tracking, and obtaining review by Google\u2019s internal Privacy Working Group and documenting approval for all material changes to location-setting and ads personalization disclosures that will have a material impact on privacy.\nKaiser\nKaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (collectively \u201cKaiser\u201d), in a stipulated judgment, agreed to be liable for $49 million to resolve allegations that the healthcare provider unlawfully disposed of medical waste, hazardous waste, and protected health information at Kaiser facilities statewide. The investigation began after district attorneys\u2019 offices conducted undercover inspections of unsecured dumpsters destined for disposal at 16 different Kaiser facilities, finding hazardous and medical waste, as well as over 10,000 paper records containing the information of over 7,700 patients. The Consumer Protection and Environment Sections subsequently partnered with six district attorneys on the investigation. As part of the settlement, Kaiser agreed to be liable for $49 million, including $42.3 million in civil penalties, fees, and costs as well as $4.9 million for environmental projects such as environmental trainings for investigators and prosecutors. The settlement also required Kaiser to take significant steps to prevent future unlawful disposals, including retaining an independent auditor to conduct trash and field audits to monitor Kaiser\u2019s compliance with the judgment and laws regarding proper disposal of regulated waste, including protected health information.\nSephora\nSephora, Inc., in a stipulated judgment, agreed to pay $1.2 million to resolve allegations that the company violated the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The Attorney General alleged that Sephora failed to disclose to consumers that it was selling their personal information, that it failed to process user requests to opt-out of sale via user-enabled global privacy controls in violation of the CCPA, and that it did not cure these violations within 30 days.  The settlement requires Sephora to clarify its online disclosures and privacy policy; provide mechanisms for consumers to opt-out of the sale of personal information, including via the Global Privacy Control;  conform its service provider agreements to the CCPA\u2019s requirements; and provide reports to the Attorney General.\nGlow\nGlow, Inc. (and its parent company, Upward Labs Holdings, Inc.), in a stipulated judgment, agreed to pay a $250,000 settlement to resolve allegations that its mobile app violated California\u2019s medical privacy and data security laws. The Glow mobile app is marketed as a fertility-tracker and stores highly sensitive data related to women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health. Our investigation found that the app had clear basic security flaws that put its users\u2019 data at risk, and that the company failed to realize that it had to comply with the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA), which goes beyond federal law to cover health apps such as Glow. The settlement requires Glow to improve the app\u2019s data security, including a first-ever injunctive term that requires Glow to consider how privacy or security lapses may uniquely impact women. Glow must also incorporate privacy and security design principles into its mobile apps, obtain affirmative consent from users prior to sharing or disclosing personal, medical, or sensitive information, and allow users to revoke previously granted consent.\nAnthem\nAnthem, a health insurance provider, in a stipulated judgment, agreed to pay a $8.69 million settlement to resolve allegations that it violated consumer protection and privacy laws arising from a 2014 data breach.  Attackers used phishing emails to gain access to Anthem\u2019s network and accessed Anthem\u2019s most sensitive database holding personal information including name, address, email address, Social Security number, healthcare identification number, and date of birth.  The data breach affected over 78 million consumers, including over 13.5 million Californians.  The settlement also requires Anthem to improve its data security. \nEquifax\nEquifax, in a nationwide settlement, agreed to pay a total of up to $600 million to resolve allegations that it improperly exposed the personal information of 147 million consumers, including 15 million Californians, in a 2017 data breach. The breach occurred after Equifax had failed to apply a critical software fix and implement security measures, including encrypting consumer Social Security numbers. The settlement requires Equifax to pay up to $425 million in restitution to affected consumers and $175 million to states in penalties, as well as provide additional benefits to consumers. The company must also implement and maintain critical data security enhancements.\nPremera Blue Cross\nPremera Blue Cross, in a stipulated judgment, agreed to pay a $10 million multi-state settlement to resolve allegations that it violated state and federal medical privacy laws arising from a 2014 data breach. Attackers used phishing emails to gain access to Premera's network and then took advantage of the company's lack of basic data security to access the personal information of 10.5 million consumers, including name, Social Security number, bank account information, medical information, and health-claims-related data.  The settlement requires Premera to improve its information security program and implement a corporate compliance program that includes an independent Chief Compliance Officer and regular program assessments.  \nAetna Inc.\nAetna Inc., in a stipulated judgment, agreed to pay $935,000 to settle an investigation of the company after its mailing vendor sent letters to 1,991 Californians that revealed through an over-sized window in the envelope that the recipients took HIV-related medication.  The settlement includes strong injunctive terms requiring Aetna to change its mailing procedures to better protect the confidentiality of medical information and conduct risk assessments for several years.\nUber Technologies, Inc.\nUber Technologies, Inc., in a stipulated final judgment, agreed to pay a $148 million nationwide settlement to resolve allegations that it violated data breach notification and reasonable data security laws in connection with a 2016 data breach where Uber failed to notify regulators and users of a data breach involving personal information. Uber instead covered up the breach for over a year, paying off hackers $100,000 for their silence. The settlement includes robust injunctive terms requiring Uber to maintain a Corporate Integrity Program, implement privacy-by-design principles, and have a comprehensive information security program. California's share of the payment, which will be split between our office and our partners at the San Francisco District Attorney's Office, is around $25.6 million.\nCottage Health System\nCottage Health System, in a stipulated final judgment, agreed to pay a $2 million settlement to resolve allegations that it failed to implement basic, reasonable safeguards to protect patient medical information in violation of state and federal privacy laws. The settlement requires Cottage to upgrade its data security practices and procedures to protect patients' medical information from unauthorized access or disclosure. It requires Cottage to maintain an information security program that meets reasonable security practices and procedures for the healthcare industry, and it requires Cottage designate an employee to serve in the capacity of a Chief Privacy Officer and to complete periodic risk assessments. This settlement follows two separate data breach incidents by Cottage Health where more than 50,000 patients' medical information was made publicly available online.\nLenovo Corporation\nLenovo Corporation, in a stipulated final judgment, agreed to pay $3.5 million to settled a multi-state investigation resolving allegations that it had illegally preinstalled ad-injecting software that compromised the security of its computers. This case marks the first time that California has held a hardware manufacturer accountable for software preinstalled on its products. As part of the settlement, Lenovo is required to adopt advanced measures to prevent future misconduct, including making clear and conspicuous disclosures about how pre-installed advertising software will operate, obtaining a consumer's affirmative consent before using such software, and providing a reasonable and effective means for consumers to opt-out, disable or remove the software. California will receive $389,204, the largest share of the 32 states involved in the settlement. The settlement was negotiated and finalized in coordination with the Federal Trade Commission.\nTarget Corporation\nTarget Corporation, in a stipulated final judgment, settled a multi-state investigation in response to allegations that over 40 million customers had their payment card information compromised during the 2013 holiday season after the company failed to provide reasonable data security. Target agreed to pay a record $18.5 million; California received more than $1.4 million, the largest share of any state. As part of the settlement, Target is required to adopt advanced measures to secure customers' information. The settlement requires Target to employ an executive to oversee a comprehensive information security program and advise its CEO and Board, encrypt or otherwise protect payment card information to make it useless if stolen, and adopt other technological measures. In addition, today's settlement in part requires Target to integrate business practices recommended in the Attorney General's Data Breach Reports previously published by the California Department of Justice.\nWells Fargo Bank\nWells Fargo Bank, in a stipulated final judgement, agreed to an $8.5 million settlement for violating California privacy laws by recording consumers' phone calls without a timely disclosure to consumers, as required by sections 632 and 632.7 of the California Penal Code. This investigation and subsequent settlement agreement was a collaboration between the Attorney General's Office and five District Attorney Offices throughout the state. Wells Fargo, a California-based bank, agreed to pay $7,616,000 in civil penalties and $384,000 in prosecutors' investigative costs, as well as contribute $500,000 to two organizations that advance consumer protection and privacy rights in California. In keeping with California's strong privacy-protection standards, Wells Fargo also agreed to make clear, conspicuous, and accurate disclosures when recording confidential communications between the bank and its customers, as well as implement an internal compliance program to ensure policy changes.\nHouzz, Inc.\nHouzz, an online platform for home remodeling and design, agreed to resolve allegations that the company violated California privacy laws by recording incoming and outgoing telephone calls without notifying all parties on the call that they were being recorded. As part of the stipulated judgment, the company agreed to appoint an individual to serve in a Chief Privacy Officer capacity who will oversee Houzz's compliance with privacy laws and who will report any significant concerns to the Chief Executive Officer and/or other senior executives, to conduct a privacy risk assessment addressing its efforts to comply with applicable privacy laws governing its U.S. operations; and to pay $175,000.\nComcast\nComcast agreed to a stipulated final judgment to resolve allegations that the company posted online the names, phone numbers and addresses of tens of thousands of customers who had paid for unlisted voice over internet protocol (\"VOIP\") phone service. Comcast agreed to improve how it handles customer complaints, strengthen its restrictions on vendors' use of personal information about customers, and provide a simple disclosure form to customers. The company Comcast must pay $25 million in penalties and investigative costs to the California Department of Justice and the California Public Utilities Commission, and approximately $8 million in additional restitution to customers whose numbers were improperly disclosed.\nAaron's, Inc.\nAaron's agreed to a stipulated final judgment to resolve allegations that the company permitted its franchised stores to install spyware on laptop computers rented to customers without their knowledge or consent, as well as charging improper late fees, overcharging customers who paid off contracts early and omitting important contract disclosures. Aaron's agreed to refund $25 million to California customers and to pay $3.4 million in civil penalties and fees.\n\nKaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc.\nKaiser agreed to a stipulated final judgment after it delayed notifying its employees after an unencrypted USB drive was discovered at a Santa Cruz thrift store that contained over 20,000 employee records. Kaiser paid $150,000 in penalties and attorneys' fees, and agreed to comply with California's data breach notification law in the future, provide notification of any future breach on a rolling basis, and implement additional training regarding the sensitive nature of employee records.\n\nCitibank, N.A.\nCitibank agreed to stipulated final judgment arising out a breach of its Citibank Online website via a known technical vulnerability that affected over 80,000 California account holders. Citibank paid $420,000 in penalties and attorneys' fees to California and $55,000 to the Connecticut Attorney General. Citibank also agreed to improve their security procedures, conduct an independent audit of Account Online, and provide credit monitoring for affected individuals for two years.\nAnthem Blue Cross\nAnthem agreed to a stipulated final judgment as a result of it printing Social Security Numbers on mailings to its customers that were visible on the envelope. Anthem paid $150,000 in penalties and attorneys' fees and agreed to implement new technical safeguards for its data management system, restrict employee access to members' Social Security numbers and provide enhanced data security training for all of its associates.\nPrivacy Amicus Filings\nFraley v. Facebook, Inc.\nThe Attorney General filed a brief for the State of California as amicus curiae in support of neither party, in Fraley v.

    "content": "\nHappy Tuesday, and welcome to another edition of Rent Free. This week's stories include:\n\nCalifornia lawmakers delay a bill to tighten the state's rent control law.\nNeighborhood activists in Roanoke, Virginia, sue to stop missing middle reforms.\nArkansas passes accessory dwelling unit reform.\n\n\nCalifornia Rent Control Bill Pulled \nThe California Legislature will not be tightening the state's rent control law this year.\nThis past Tuesday, Assemblymember Ash Kalra (D\u2013San Jose) pulled his bill, Assembly Bill 1157, which would have capped statewide rent increases at residential properties to the lesser of 2 percent plus inflation or 5 percent.\nCurrent state law allows rent increases of up to 10 percent. Kalra's bill would have also expanded California's statewide rent control policy to single-family homes and condominiums.\n\n\nRent Free Newsletter by Christian Britschgi. Get more of Christian's urban regulation, development, and zoning coverage.\n\n\nKalra's bill isn't fully dead. KQED reports it will be considered next year in the latter half of the California Legislature's biennial session.\nA.B. 1157 had passed the Assembly's housing committee. It was just a few years ago that California became the second state in the country (after Oregon) to adopt statewide rent controls.\nKalra's bill naturally attracted the opposition of the state's landlords and real estate interests. Some of the YIMBY groups that had supported California's 2019 rent control law came out against Kalra's bill as excessively restrictive.\nNevertheless, rent control's popularity as a solution to high rents is growing. Just last week, the Washington state Legislature approved a statewide rent control measure.\nDespite the rehabilitation of rent control's image, it remains as bad an idea as ever.\n\nArkansas Legalizes ADUs \nLast week, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed into law House Bill 1503, which requires municipal governments to allow accessory dwelling units (ADUs) on single-family properties.\n\nUnder the new law, property owners can build an ADU that's 75 percent of the size of the primary dwelling or 1,000 square feet (whichever is less). Local governments will be required to approve these units without requiring public hearings or special permits.\nH.B. 1503 also prohibits local governments from imposing minimum parking standards, certain aesthetic design features, and owner-occupancy requirements. Impact fees are capped at $250.\nAll told, it's a pretty clean, thorough ADU legalization that precludes any number of local regulations that could typically make ADU construction impractical. It's proof that this kind of YIMBY reform is becoming more science than art.\n\nAnother Lawsuit Challenges Missing Middle Reform in Virginia \nOn the local front, neighborhood activists in Roanoke, Virginia, are suing to overturn the city's \"missing middle\" reforms.\nBack in March 2024, Roanoke passed zoning reforms that allowed ADUs, duplexes, and triplexes in single-family neighborhoods.\nAs has happened in other Virginia communities that have adopted similar reforms, the zoning changes immediately provoked a lawsuit from critics who argued the City Council didn't give the proper public notice before voting on the changes.\nAs the Roanoke Rambler reports, the city attempted to cure that procedural violation by repassing its zoning reforms in September 2024. Plaintiffs, however, continue to argue that the new reforms irrationally increase density, which does nothing for affordable housing but does increase traffic, noise, and the like.\nThe Rambler notes that only a few dozen units legalized by the 2024 zoning reforms have been approved by the city.\nThat's to be expected. In localities that legalize missing middle housing, the typical result is a slight increase in new duplexes, triplexes, and ADUs being built.\nCritics are factually correct when they say that this small increase in construction will have a minimal impact on aggregate home prices and rents.\nNevertheless, missing middle units are typically cheaper than the single-family home that would be built instead. In that way, they do provide some more affordable options in desirable neighborhoods. Homebuyers and renters benefit from the additional choice. Property owners benefit from the additional ability to develop their properties.\nRoanoke is currently attempting to get the lawsuit challenging the zoning reforms dismissed.\nIn September 2024, a judge struck down Arlington, Virginia's missing middle reforms in response to a similar lawsuit.\n\nQuick Links\n\nThe New York Times covers the Trump administration's plans for building housing on federal lands.\nPittsburgh's planning commission recommends that the City Council require that new apartment buildings include money-losing below-market-rate units.\nThe White House budget proposal includes major cuts to federal housing programs.\nAn ambitious zoning reform package is reportedly dead in the Minnesota Legislature.\nCould the California Environmental Quality Act stop Trump's plans to reopen Alcatraz?\n\n\n",

    "title": "AB 1482: The California Tenant Protection Act of 2019 | Berkeley Rent Board",
    "content": "This webpage discusses several important aspects of AB 1482, but does not cover every aspect and is not a substitute for reading the law itself, which can be found at California Civil Code sections 1946.2 and 1947.12.AB 1482 is a state law that can only be enforced in state court.\u00a0 Rent Board housing counselors can provide general guidance on what the law requires, but cannot provide legal advice.\u00a0 Please contact an attorney or a local advocacy organization if you need legal advice or help with exercising your rights in court.Overview of AB 1482AB 1482 is a statewide law that went into effect on January 1, 2020 and expires on January 1, 2030. It does two main things:Requires a landlord to have a \u201cjust cause\u201d in order to terminate a tenancy.Limits annual rent increases to no more than 5% + local CPI, or 10% whichever is lower. CPI refers to the Consumer Price Index, which reflects the inflation rate.A tenant may not waive their rights to these protections and any agreement to do so by the tenant is not enforceable.AB 1482 Does Not Change or Replace Berkeley\u2019s Rent OrdinanceIf a unit is already covered by Berkeley\u2019s local eviction and/or rent increase regulations, the unit remains subject to the local regulations. In other words, AB 1482 does not limit, change, or take away the rent control or just cause for eviction protections of Berkeley\u2019s Rent Ordinance.Types of Housing Covered By AB 1482All housing located in the state of California is covered by AB 1482 unless it falls into one of the categories of exemption discussed below (units covered by Berkeley\u2019s Rent Ordinance fall into an exemption for the rent increase regulations, which is why AB 1482 does not change Berkeley\u2019s local rent control protections).Units that are exempt from both the \u201cjust cause\u201d eviction provisions and rent limitationsUnits that were constructed within the last 15 years. This applies on a rolling basis.\u00a0 For example, a unit constructed on January 1, 2006 is exempt as of January 1,\u00a0 2020, but becomes covered by AB 1482 protections on and after January 1, 2021.Affordable housing units.Certain dormitories.A two-unit property, if the second unit was occupied by an owner of the property for the entire period of the tenancy.Single-family homes and condominiums are only exempt if the two conditions discussed below apply.Exemption Conditions for Single-Family Homes and CondominiumsSingle-family homes and condominiums are only exempt from AB 1482 if BOTH of the following conditions apply:The property is not owned by one of the following: a real estate trust, a corporation, or an LLC with at least one corporate member.\u00a0AND\u00a0The landlord notified the tenant in writing that the tenancy is not subject to the \u201cjust cause\u201d and rent increase limitations as specifically described in Civil Code Sections 1946.2(e)(8)(B)(i) and 1947.12(d)(5)(B)(i). More information about this requirement, including mandatory language, is provided in the Notice section of this webpage.The limited exemption for single-family homes does not apply where there is more than one dwelling unit on the same lot, or any second residential unit in the building that cannot be sold separately from the subject unit (such as an in-law unit).Units exempt from the rent limitationsUnits that are already subject to a local rent control ordinance that restricts annual rent increases to an amount less than 5% + CPI.Units exempt from \u201cjust cause\u201d eviction provisionsUnits that are already subject to a local ordinance that requires \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate a tenancy and is more protective than state law (like the protections in Berkeley\u2019s Rent Ordinance).Single-family, owner-occupied residences where the owner rents no more than two bedrooms or units, including accessory dwelling units and junior accessory dwelling units.Housing accommodations in which the tenant shares bathroom or kitchen facilities with the owner, if the owner lives at the property as their principal residence.Housing provided by a nonprofit hospital, church, extended care facility, licensed extended care facility for the elderly, or an adult residential facility.Transient and tourist hotel occupancy as defined by Civil Code section 1940(B).Landlords Must Give Tenants Notice if AB 1482 Applies to a Unit or if they are claiming the single-family home or condominium exemptionNotice to All Tenants in Units Covered by the LawAll tenants in units covered by the state law must receive a notice explaining the \u201cjust cause\u201d and rent limitation protections. For a tenancy existing prior to July 1, 2020, the notice must be provided in writing to the tenant no later than August 1, 2020, or as an addendum to the lease or rental agreement. For any tenancy started or renewed on or after July 1, 2020, the notice must be provided as an addendum to the lease or rental agreement, or as a written notice signed by the tenant with a copy provided to the tenant. The notice language must read:\u201cCalifornia law limits the amount your rent can be increased. See Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code for more information. California law also provides that after all of the tenants have continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 12 months or more or at least one of the tenants has continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 24 months or more, a landlord must provide a statement of cause in any notice to terminate a tenancy. See Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code for more information.\u201dNotice Requirement for Owners Claiming the Single-Family Home or Condominium ExemptionAn owner claiming an exemption from AB 1482\u00a0 because the property is a single-family home or condominium must provide a written notice to the tenant. For a tenancy existing before July 1, 2020, this notice may, but is not required to, be provided in the rental agreement. For any tenancy started or renewed on or after July 1, 2020, this notice must be provided in the rental agreement. If the owner does not provide the required notice, then a single-family home or condominium is NOT exempt from the \u201cjust cause\u201d or rent cap regulations. The notice language must read:\u201cThis property is not subject to the rent limits imposed by Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code and is not subject to the just cause requirements of Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code. This property meets the requirements of Sections 1947.12 (d)(5) and 1946.2 (e)(8) of the Civil Code and the owner is not any of the following: (1) a real estate investment trust, as defined by Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code; (2) a corporation; or (3) a limited liability company in which at least one member is a corporation.\u201d1940(b).\u201d\u201cJust Cause\u201d Eviction Provisions under AB 1482The eviction provisions only apply after all tenants have lived in the unit for 12 months or more, or where at least one tenant has occupied the unit for 24 months.A tenancy may not be terminated unless the landlord has one of the allowable \u201cjust cause\u201d reasons, which must be stated in the notice terminating tenancy.\u201cJust cause\u201d reasons are categorized as either \u201cat-fault\u201d reasons or \u201cno-fault\u201d reasons. Relocation assistance is required for \u201cno-fault\u201d evictions.The mere expiration of a lease or rental agreement is not a \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate a tenancy.The \u201cjust cause\u201d reasons for eviction are set forth in California Civil Code section 1946.2(b).Rent Increase Limits Under AB 1482The current applicable CPI increase for Berkeley (that is, from August 1, 2024 to July 31, 2025), is 3.8%. Thus, the maximum annual increase for units subject to AB 1482 is currently 8.8% (3.8% + 5%). If the increase is effective on or after August 1, 2025, a different CPI increase will apply.For covered units, annual rent increases are limited to no more than 5% plus the percentage change in the cost of living for the region in which the property is located, or 10% whichever is lower. \"Percentage change in the cost of living\" means the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers for All Items for the metropolitan area in which the property is located, as published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. If a regional index is not available, the CPI Index for All Urban Consumers for all items, as determined by the Department of Industrial Relations, shall apply.For rent increases that take effect before August 1 of any calendar year, the percentage change is calculated using the amount published for April (or March, if no amount is published for April) of the immediately preceding calendar year and April (or March) of the year before that.For rent increases that take effect on or after August 1 of any calendar year, the percentage change is calculated using the amount published for April (or March, if no amount is published for April) of that calendar year and April (or March) of the immediately preceding calendar year.The percentage change must be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of one percent.No more than two increases in a 12-month period, and the combined amount cannot exceed the 5% + CPI cap.The total rent paid by subtenants to a master tenant cannot exceed the rent charged by the landlord.There is no limit on the initial rent charged for a vacant unit.\n",

    "title": "Is the secret to housing affordability in California buried in the building code? - Stocktonia News",
    "content": "\nThis story was originally published by\u00a0CalMatters.\u00a0Sign up\u00a0for their newsletters.\nAs lawmakers scramble to turbocharge post-fire recovery efforts in Los Angeles and to tackle a housing shortage across the state, a new addition may be coming to California\u2019s building code: A pause button.\nAssembly Bill 306\u00a0would freeze the building standards \u2014 the rules governing the architecture, the layout, the electrical wiring, the plumbing, the energy use and the fire and earthquake safety features \u2014 for all new housing through at least 2031. Local governments, which often tack on their own requirements, would also be kept from doing so in most cases.\u00a0\nBuilding standards tend to reflect the state\u2019s most pressing concerns. New seismic requirements are added after\u00a0major earthquakes, home-hardening requirements have\u00a0followed deadly fires\u00a0and new green energy mandates have popped up as California has raced to prepare for a warmer planet.\nThis latest proposed change to the code is meant to tackle another crisis:\u00a0affordability.\nThe bill wouldn\u2019t delete any of the current rules, which are widely considered to be among the most stringent of any state\u2019s. It would also include exceptions, most notably for emergency health and safety updates. But on the whole, the California building code would be set on cruise control for the better half of a decade.\nAssemblymember Nick Schultz, a freshman Democrat from Burbank and the lead author of the bill, said there\u2019s nothing extreme about leaving the code as it is for a few years, particularly as homeowners in Altadena and the Palisades rebuild.\u00a0\nThough Schultz introduced the bill, the second listed co-author may explain why such a significant policy change swept through the Assembly with little resistance: Speaker Robert Rivas. In early April the bill passed out of the Assembly with 71 \u201cyes\u201d votes. No lawmakers voted against it. Now it heads to the state Senate.\nSuch smooth legislative sailing notwithstanding, plenty of environmental advocates, renewable energy industry groups, construction unions, structural engineers and code enforcement officials have turned out to oppose the bill.\nBuilding standards need to be nimble because the effects of climate change are unpredictable, said Laura Walsh, policy manager with Save the Bay, a nonprofit focused on conservation and preparing for rising seas. They see it as a radical upending of the way the state regulates buildings, reduces emissions and prepares for a changed climate.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to a place in the trend where things get worse really fast,\u201d she said.\nBeyond the specifics of the debate, the bill represents something fairly new in the politics of California housing.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just this idea that if you simplify things in some ways, it will help. \u2026 The driver of cost in California for housing is not code.\u201d \u2014  Merrian Borgeson, policy director, Natural Resources Defense Council\n\nOver the last decade, lawmakers in Sacramento have passed a raft of bills aimed at making it easier to\u00a0build new homes. Most of those bills have set their sights on the zoning code \u2014 the patchwork of land-use standards that dictate which types of buildings can go where. If you recall any high-profile political battles about apartment buildings in\u00a0exclusive suburbs, dense residential development\u00a0near transit stops\u00a0or proposed\u00a0mountain lion sanctuaries\u00a0\u2014 that\u2019s all about zoning.\nNow some lawmakers are considering a new deregulatory target. Schultz\u2019s freeze is the most dramatic example of a handful of bills this year that would take on the impenetrably technical, frequently overlooked and ever-changing building code \u2014 all for the cause of cheaper housing.\u00a0\nAs California legislators are \u201cfinding religion on land use, other issues are sort of bubbling up,\u201d said Stephen Smith, founder of the Center for Building in North America, a nonprofit that advocates for changes to building codes that make it easier to build apartment buildings. \u201cArchitects, developers, contractors are pointing out, \u2018No, actually, there are barriers in the actual construction process and many of those do go back to the building code.\u2019\u201d\nWhere does the building code come from?\nCalifornia\u2019s building code does not originate in California.\u00a0\nAs with most states, our code takes as its jumping off point a set of general rules written by the International Code Council, a nonprofit organization governed by a mix of building industry associations, state and local regulators, engineers and architects. Despite the name, the organization is based in Washington D.C. and its model codes are a predominantly North American product.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like naming the World Series the World Series,\u201d said Eduardo Mendoza, a research associate with California YIMBY, an organization that promotes more housing development.\nThe Code Council puts out its model codes every three years. The state then gets to work on its own version in a year-long process involving seven state departments.\u00a0\nThe housing market is sending mixed messages about whether greater Stockton will be a great place to buy or sell a home in 2025. (File photo by Edward Lopez/Stocktonia)\nThese exceedingly arcane deliberations typically receive little attention from the public. The exception is a small cadre of engineers, developers, architects, appliance manufacturers, energy efficiency, solar and climate advocates and other parties with a direct financial or ideological interest in the way new things get built.\u00a0\nFor these groups, the triannual code adoption cycle \u2014 and the \u201cintervening\u201d amendment process for urgent updates \u2014 make for an endless game of regulatory tug-of-war.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very bureaucratic, very dry, but still extremely political,\u201d said Mendoza.\nNow that behind-the-scenes fight is playing out in public.\u00a0\nOn one side are housing developers. Keeping up with the salvo of state and local building code changes is its own full-time job, said Dan Dunmoyer, president of the California Building Industry Association, a trade group for big builders.\u00a0\n\u201cWe had the most seismically safe, water-reduced, fire retardant, energy efficient homes in the world two years ago and we just keep on adding more and more and more to it,\u201d he said. \u201cAt what point do you just take a pause?\u201d\nA potential pause is especially appealing to many affordable housing developers, who typically rely on multiple sources of funding, all with their own restrictions and timelines. If a change in the building code means going back to the architectural drawing board and delaying a permit application, that can put off a potential project \u201canother year or two,\u201d said Laura Archuleta, president of Jamboree Housing Corporation, a nonprofit low-income housing developer in Irvine.\nCalifornia would not be the first state to consider\u00a0tapping the breaks on its building code. In 2023, legislators in North Carolina passed a law banning most changes through 2031. That bill, backed by that state\u2019s building industry association, froze in place a significantly older code than California\u2019s; some of North Carolina\u2019s energy efficiency rules\u00a0hadn\u2019t been changed since 2009.\nCalifornia\u2019s so-called 2025 code is currently in the works and is set to go into effect in January 2026, but not if Schultz\u2019s measure passes. The bill would freeze the current rules in place starting on June 1.\nThe experts who help write the state\u2019s building standards have \u201chealth and safety and other criteria in mind but they don\u2019t have cost as a factor in their decision making \u2014 well, they should,\u201d said Assemblymember Chris Ward, a San Diego Democrat who voted for Schultz\u2019s bill. He is also the author of two other building code related bills this year. One would require the state to consider subjecting small apartment buildings to a\u00a0more relaxed set of standards. The other would reevaluate whether builder should have more flexibility in meeting the state\u2019s\u00a0energy efficiency rules.\nWard said that mining the building code for possible cost savings is an idea embraced by a growing number of his colleagues.\u00a0\n\u201cThe theme of the year has been \u2018let\u2019s all focus in on the cost of construction and on reducing the cost of housing,\u201d he said.\nWhat\u2019s the real cost driver?\nOpponents of the bill argue that in their quest for affordability, supporters have either picked the wrong villain \u2014 or, at the very least, approached the problem with a sledgehammer when what\u2019s needed is a scalpel.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s just this idea that if you simplify things in some ways, it will help,\u201d said Merrian Borgeson, policy director with Natural Resources Defense Council, who calls the bill \u201cwell-intentioned\u201d if fundamentally flawed in its premise. \u201cThe driver of cost in California for housing is not code.\u201d\nThe state\u2019s building industry disagrees.\nAccording to estimates provided by the state industry association, major building standard updates over the last 15 years have added between $51,000 and $117,000 to construction costs on each single-family home. By far the largest estimated cost, with an upper end of $65,000, was the price tag on the water utility hook-up required for sprinkler systems mandated in new single-family homes since 2011. California, Maryland and Washington D.C. are the only state-level jurisdictions with this requirement.\nFramers work to build the Ruby Street apartments in Castro Valley on Feb. 6, 2024. (Photo by Camille Cohen for CalMatters)\nFor apartment buildings alone, a national study sponsored by the building industry attributed\u00a011% of total development costs\u00a0to changes in the International Code Council model codes since 2012.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s impossible to independently verify any of these estimates. But if code changes don\u2019t cost much, developers certainly seem to act as if they do. Reuben Duarte, a land-use planner with the California Chapter of the American Planning Association, said in the months before a scheduled code update, city planning departments are always the scene of \u201ca mad rush from developers who are trying to get in\u201d before the new rules go into effect.\nA code for cheaper construction\nMost of the big ticket changes to California\u2019s standards over the last decade have been about energy efficiency and electrification. Some of these requirements have added upfront costs for developers, said Matt Vespa, an attorney with the environmental legal nonprofit Earthjustice, but they ultimately save homeowners in the long-run.\u00a0\n\u201cThe cost of housing is just one part of affordability,\u201d he said. He pointed to possible energy code changes that would allow homes to calculate their electricity needs differently, potentially saving on costly capacity upgrades. \u201cThose energy code enhancements could save people money on their energy bills and that is part of affordability. Why is that completely not considered in this equation?\u201d\nIt\u2019s that prospect of preventing changes to the code that might actually save money that has even some pro-building, \u201cyes in my backyard\u201d advocates concerned about the bill as currently written.\nHow could the building code make a building less expensive to build? A 2023 law, for example, directs state regulators to consider letting developers build apartment buildings over three stories with\u00a0just one staircase\u00a0rather than at least two. Single stair construction is an architectural\u00a0mainstay outside that United States\u00a0that allows for more housing to occupy a given lot and is estimated to bring down construction costs on mid-sized apartment buildings\u00a0by as much as 13%\u00a0without obviously elevating fire risk.\nSchultz\u2019s bill includes a carve out for any future single stair changes. It also includes exceptions for code amendments aimed at making it easier to convert office buildings into apartments and condos, another\u00a0legislative directive. But additional cost-saving changes could get frozen out.\u00a0\nHousing construction in a neighborhood in Elk Grove on July 8, 2022. (Photo by Rahul Lal, CalMatters)\nOne possibility: Dallas, Texas, recently adopted a new, relaxed set of codes for\u00a0mid-sized apartment buildings, a considerable step down from the rules in place in most American cities where they share a set of standards with skyscrapers.\nSmith with the Center for Building said he understands why someone who \u201cjust doesn\u2019t trust that the building code development process is going to appropriately balance affordability and all the other concerns\u201d would support the bill. But \u201cit\u2019s a little upsetting to see everyone throwing the baby out with the bath water,\u201d he said.\nThe \u201cbaby,\u201d in this case, refers to possible cost-reducing changes that Smith said are more likely to be found for apartment buildings.\u00a0\n\u201cIf I were a single family developer, I\u2019d be a lot more happy with the code as it is than if I were a multifamily developer and a lot more eager to fix it in place,\u201d said Smith.\nSchultz stressed that though the bill has already passed out of the Assembly, it remains a work in progress. He said he is currently negotiating possible changes to the bill that would allow for a general \u201cescape hatch\u201d for any proposed \u201cchanges to the code that might actually reduce the cost of housing.\u201d\nAfter all, he added, \u201cThat is the goal.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\nWant more?

    "title": "California's Rent Cap Debate: Something's Gotta Give - Terner Center",
    "content": "\nThe Terner Center for Housing Innovation first became involved in discussions around rent control policy in California leading up to Proposition 10, the ballot initiative in 2018 (ultimately defeated) that would have repealed the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, the statewide framework put in place by the state legislature in 1995 to set limitations on local rent control ordinances. History tells us that the debate over Costa-Hawkins itself was a divisive and hard-fought battle. It\u2019s no surprise that stakeholders and policymakers are having a difficult time finding a path forward today.\nIn May 2018, after research and meetings with a variety of stakeholders, the Terner Center released a brief\u00a0Finding Common Ground on Rent Control. The purpose of this brief was to outline policy measures that 1) appeared to have the broadest conceptual consensus from varied stakeholders and thus provided a basis for negotiating a legislative solution and 2) could thread the needle between the desire to protect tenants from rental increases and displacement while at the same time recognize the critical need to ensure continued new construction and investment in rental housing. There is no question that ultimately the housing affordability challenges in California require that more homes and apartments be built quickly and in a cost-effective manner.\nThe brief tested four potential concepts. The one that had the most potential for agreement among stakeholders was the \u201canti-gouging\u201d cap on rent increases. This concept was, at least in part, the basis for\u00a0Assembly Bill 1482, introduced by Assembly Member David Chiu.\u00a0Around the same time, the Bay Area\u00a0CASA Compact\u00a0also used elements of this concept and refined it into a legislative intention document.\u00a0 The CASA Compact included some very specific provisions to ensure flexibility of a rent cap in times of extreme inflation, economic distress, or major capital improvements. This included the ability to pass through additional rent increases up to a certain, separate cap after an economic downturn (according to a banking formula), actual increases in public charges including utilities and property taxes, and amortized capital improvements allowed under IRS rules. CASA did not develop the actual formulas for these pass-throughs, and envisioned a rent cap that was fixed in duration (15 years).\nWhere We Are Today\nRecently, in response to a number of significant amendments to AB 1482 prior to its most recent hearing in the Assembly Judiciary Committee, the Terner Center released a new brief,\u00a0Curbing Runaway Rents: Assessing the Impact of a Rent Cap in California.\u00a0We concluded in the brief that, overall, even though the rent cap was increased from CPI plus 5 percent to CPI plus 7 percent, and curtailed some of its scope on single-family homes, the bill would still protect as many as 4.6 million households not covered today. Assembly Member Chiu should be commended for working hard to find a common ground solution so that these protections can be realized given the extraordinary pace of rent increases in recent years.\nYet more work needs to be done, in a very short window, to have this legislation realized. While the bill narrowly passed the Judiciary Committee, further action is needed to better balance protections with production concerns. Those concerns include 1) first and foremost, not impeding new construction; 2) a lack of certainty\u2014especially for potential investors in future development projects\u2014that, if these caps are agreed to, they won\u2019t be changed in the future; and 3) the need for a \u201csafety valve\u201d in times of stress (e.g., market downturns, unforeseen new government code or regulatory cost or tax increases, and water/power and other utility cost increases). These concerns are inter-related as changes in language in the bill (or lack of language addressing the concern) on one can impact the others.\nRecent amendments to the bill have exacerbated these concerns. The decision to sunset the bill in 3 years, paired with the new provision exempting developments built 10 years prior to the bill\u2019s adoption, has led to concerns that the intent may be to extend the rent cap beyond the 3 years and initiate a \u201crolling\u201d rent regulation on new buildings within 10 years of placing them in service. Rolling rent regulation was one of the proposals we tested in our earlier May 2018 brief. We came to the conclusion then that there is a wide gulf between renter advocates and developer and owners regarding the window for rolling inclusion. For renters and advocates, 10 years is the longest that could be considered. Concerned that too narrow a window would have a chilling effect on investment, developers and owners held a wide range of views, starting at 20 to 40 years\u2014although for some, there is no window that would be acceptable.\nWe are not aware of any study evaluating a long term rent cap such as the one proposed by California and covering new construction. The development and financial community are concerned that a \u201crolling rent control\u201d would raise the specter of closing off new construction funds. This heightened risk, on top of already thin return margins due to rising construction costs, could lead to \u201ccapital flight\u201d from California housing into other assets that have more certainty of returning capital profitably over the useful life of the invested asset. A rent cap policy that risks capital flight from housing could significantly reduce or stall out new housing construction in California\u2014with dire impacts on long-term affordability.\nWhere to Go from Here\nIt is possible to design a rent cap bill that would address these issues. On this core tension of passing a bill that protects tenants without inhibiting new construction and investment, I see three options:\n\nExempt new construction from AB 1482\nBuild out language that provides a \u201csafety valve\u201d to building owners/investors\nTake on and resolve all of the outstanding issues now, for a longer-term (not 3-year) rent cap\n\nOption 1- Exempt New Construction\nThis option would mean amending the bill language to remove the 10-year exemption and specifying that, moving forward, new construction would be exempt from the rent cap. This option is the simplest to do in the short run. It has merit since AB 1482 sunsets in three years. Given that limited timeframe, taking out the provision that creates a 10-year exemption would have no immediate negative impact on newly constructed buildings, yet would extend immediate protection for tenants at a time of crisis.\nThe downside for this approach for those who want rolling rent regulation is that, without the 10-year exclusion, just \u201cextending\u201d the law after 3 years would not extend rent cap regulations to previously excluded buildings.\nGiven the stalemate and lack of consensus on this issue, exempting new construction and \u201cpunting\u201d on the rolling inclusion issue is an appropriate short-term response.\nOption 2- Provide a Safety Valve\nAdding language to the bill to provide a safety valve for the type of unforeseen circumstances discussed above is no easy task. The first decision is whether such provisions are adjudicated building by building through administrative procedures laid out in the bill and implemented via a state or other agency.\u00a0 Such an approach would be costly and take considerable time to put into place. It would require extensive data collection (even more than the rental property data registry proposed in Assembly Bill 724, proposed by Assembly Member Buffy Wicks and which failed to win enough votes to proceed from the Appropriations Committee, partly based on concerns about its cost).\nThe alternative is to create standards or \u201ctriggers\u201d that if met, are automatically available to the building owner, and thereby self-regulating. Examples of such triggers could be:\n\nInflationary Times:\u00a0 If the regional CPI (and we strongly recommend regional CPI, not the statewide CPI as this could vary dramatically by submarkets), goes above 10% for more than six months, then the 10% cap would increase by up to 2 additional points until it has fallen below the 10% threshold again. There are of course many discussions to be had and formulas to evaluate with such a trigger, such as the timeframes and the added cushion provided.\nEconomic Distress: In recessionary times (and these again could occur on a regional and not statewide basis), building owners may have years (as happened during the Great Recession) when they are not able to raise rents and not able to adequately cover expenses. As our historical data (Figure 1)\u00a0demonstrate, 2010 and 2011 were years the CPI was negative. Building owners are unlikely to be able to raise rents much, if at all, during these times if the real estate market, job market, and wages are negatively impacted. Therefore, building owners could be eligible to \u201cbank\u201d some or all of the rent increases they are unable to charge during this period. Again, there are many nuances that would need to be determined for this trigger, including how quickly owners could use any \u201cbanked\u201d rents to avoid rent shocks when the market recovers. The original CASA proposal recommended that landlords should be able to bank unused rent increases for 3 to 5 years and, when drawing on banked increases, landlords should not be able to raise rents more than 10 to 15% annually.\n\nFigure 1:\nSource: Finding Common Ground on Rent Control, Terner Center Analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics Data on All Urban Consumers\nThese two triggers do not cover all of the possible unforeseen circumstances that may arise including a local or state imposed a new requirement on building owners (seismic retrofits, energy efficient upgrades) or simply a large building system failure or necessary capital improvement. These situations are less predictable and finding a self-regulating trigger is more difficult.\nThis strategy has significant merit as it provides a safety valve that could garner support from apartment owners. The primary, and not insignificant challenge, is forging consensus on these complicated provisions (and getting them right) in such a truncated period of time.\nOption 3\u2014Address Underlying Concerns Now for a Longer-Term Cap\nWhile the two options above could solve a core issue for a number of stakeholders and perhaps garner enough votes to move forward, neither of these options will satisfy everyone. The remaining alternative is to find a compromise that solves the broader issues that led to making AB 1482 a short-term 3-year bill. That means addressing the fear that the rent cap law would create a new battle year after year as participants on all sides advocate for amendments, including lowering what is meant to be an \u201canti-gouging\u201d cap to create stricter rent controls.\nAs enticing as this option may be for some, it is hard to imagine forging a consensus on these outstanding issues in any short order. If this option is pursued, the risk is that the status quo will continue unabated and the opportunity to create certainty will actually have been missed. Rental tenant protection advocates will not give up trying to make change through ballot initiatives, and the owners and developers will continue to spend money to defeat such efforts. But what will change for tenants in the meantime?\nConclusion\nWhen it comes to the state\u2019s housing crisis, the stakes are high, and there are no easy answers or silver-bullet solutions for policy-makers. The Terner Center encourages the use of data to guide decision-making whenever possible and to be cautious with creating uncertainties that could unintentionally worsen the crisis for residents over time by chilling investments in rental housing that is so badly needed in California. But something needs to be done to address the severity of today\u2019s crisis: year-over-year rent increases and extraordinary rent increases are untenable and unsustainable. The status quo must change, and it will take both near-term and longer-term solutions to make that happen. A statewide anti-gouging rent cap could provide one tool to immediately address the worst effects of the crisis for millions of Californians, and do so in a way that does not stymie future production of much needed housing. There is still a possibility for a compromise on a bill that could begin to change the status quo, but the clock is ticking.\n\n",

    "title": "Making the Case for Data Transparency and Clarifying the Goals of Recent Brief on Rising Rents - Terner Center",
    "content": " \nLetter from Ben Metcalf, Managing Director\nOur recent brief Rising Rents, Not Enough Data generated quite a few calls and emails regarding our methods as well as our intent in publication. We heard concerns that this brief seemed to lack the Terner Center\u2019s typical objective lens. We appreciate the feedback and I wanted to take a minute to respond to these concerns.\nFirst, let me clarify what the brief did not do. It did not seek to take a position on whether California\u2019s rent cap law, AB 1482, should be amended to increase eligibility or whether local rent control ordinances should be enacted or changed. And it did not attempt to model whether the high rates of rent increases that we saw from the 2021-2022 time period following the pandemic are likely to continue. Nor was it able to explore actual rates of compliance with AB 1482.\nNext, let me clarify what the brief\u2019s goals were. This brief aimed to show the need for better data on the rental market in order to evaluate the impact of policies like AB 1482. The brief sought to highlight a longstanding Terner Center concern: without better data on changes in rent prices, we cannot know if and how policies are working in practice. But California\u2019s rent cap is just one example where better rental data would make a difference. Whether it\u2019s protecting tenants or encouraging new rental housing construction, we need to know what is happening with current rents in order to know if policies are working.\nThat said, we recognize how our findings in this paper could be taken out of context or used to support positions that we were not taking. It\u2019s our job to not just to get the facts right, but also to ensure we\u2019re contributing to a greater shared understanding of the issues from all sides. By focusing on AB 1482 as the sole basis for the need for better rental data, we missed an opportunity to present a stronger and more balanced case. For example, more up-to-date and complete rental data could help policymakers better calibrate how long (and at what levels) to extend and sustain emergency rental assistance or how to better target federal housing vouchers to the locations and people who need them most. Unit-level rental data could also help us determine the impact of expanding housing supply or track the affordability of new units created by state policy changes. Expanding public data on rents is not a radical proposal.\u00a0 Indeed, we have publicly-available mortgage data, which has allowed researchers to shape and study the effect of policies designed to expand access to homeownership for decades. We would like to see the same kind of transparency in the rental market.\nThe Terner Center prides itself on the rigor of its research and the soundness of its conclusions. We don\u2019t shy away from controversial topics but we do strive to make sure our contributions can productively shift the policy conversation; in this case, we could have done better. Please keep the feedback coming; my door is always open.\nBen Metcalf, Managing Director\n\n\n",

    "content": " \n\nIn 2019, in the midst of eroding housing affordability and concerns about evictions and displacement, California passed the Tenant Protection Act (AB 1482), which includes a statewide rent cap to protect tenants from steep rent increases. Three years later, however, rapidly rising rents for advertised rentals offer a stark picture of how, without adequate outreach, enforcement, and transparency, the law may not be fulfilling its promise in today\u2019s significantly different economic climate. A new brief, co-published by the Terner Center for Housing Innovation and TechEquity Collaborative, explores the market dynamics pushing up rents across the state, and offers recommendations for policies that might strengthen accountability.\nRising Rents, Not Enough Data: How a Lack of Transparency Threatens to Undermine California\u2019s Rent Cap finds that 60 percent of repeat rental listings posted in the spring of 2022 had an annual price increase that would be in excess of the state\u2019s annual rent cap were the cap to apply to units relisted for new tenants. The trend is widespread beyond coastal markets, with major metros throughout California, including inland communities such as Fresno, Bakersfield, and Riverside, seeing a majority of units listed in the spring increase in price by greater than 10 percent.\nAvailable data do not allow us to differentiate between rent increases for those households who are eligible for rent cap protections and those who are not. However, this analysis reveals market conditions that are hospitable to large rent increases, demonstrating the critical need for education, enforcement, and real-time, accessible data to ensure the law is working as intended to protect renters.\nRead the full analysis on our website here.\nRead a statement from our Managing Director Ben Metcalf responding to concerns that we have received about the intention and methods behind this recent brief.\n\n\n",

    "title": "What Small Multifamily Rental Property Owners Tell Us About Implementation of Tenant Protection Laws - Terner Center",
    "content": "\nAuthor: Shazia Manji, Research Associate\nThough roughly 35 percent of the US population lives in rental housing, no comprehensive or uniform set of laws protects tenants across cities and states. Instead, a patchwork of local, state, and federal policies regulate rental properties. As the housing crisis has escalated, advocates and policymakers have pushed for and passed new laws to protect tenants from evictions, rising rent burdens, and discrimination. But passing new laws is only half the battle. Proactive education and enforcement is crucial to ensure that owners are aware of and abiding by these new laws, and that renters realize their intended benefits.\nEducation and enforcement may be especially important for owners of smaller properties. These owners tend to be less professionalized than those with larger properties. Unlike large corporate owners for whom renting is a business, they tend to be individuals who manage a small number of units part time or for retirement income. They are more likely to rent their units below market, but may be less familiar with the patchwork of laws and regulations that govern their properties.\nTo shed light on this issue, we draw on results from a national survey of owners of small multifamily rental properties (those with 5 to 49 units) conducted between July and September of 2022. Totaling about 8.2 million units, these properties make up 17 percent of the nation\u2019s rental housing\u2014and are a significant source of unsubsidized affordable housing. Our recently published study, Ownership and Management of Small Multifamily Rental Properties, provides a snapshot of this part of the market, and highlights the importance of preserving these properties.\nWe asked owners about six different types of tenant protection laws (Figure 1), including whether they believed these laws applied to the property surveyed. Versions of these laws have been passed by cities, counties, and states across the country. Some have been in place for decades, while others have only recently been enacted. In this analysis, we share survey findings about owner awareness and perceptions of the tenant protection laws across the country and in California.\nFigure 1. Tenant Protection Laws at a Glance\n\n\n\nTenant Protection\nDescription\nExample\n\n\nRent Control or Stabilization Laws\nTo help maintain housing affordability and protect tenants against egregious rent hikes, rent control or stabilization laws set limits on how much rent can be charged or raised.\nIn California, AB 1482 (2019) caps annual rent increases for existing tenants at 5% + inflation, or 10%, whichever is lower. The law does not apply to properties less than 15 years old, non-corporate-owned single-family rentals, and owner-occupied duplexes.\n\n\nFee Regulations\nFee regulations set limits on fees that can be charged to tenants\u2014such as security deposits and late rent or move-in fees.\nIn Chicago, the Residential Landlord Tenant Ordinance limits late rent fees to $10 per month on rents under $500 plus 5% per month on any amount exceeding $500. Certain properties are exempt\u2014for example, units in owner-occupied buildings with six units or less, employee housing, and school dormitories.\n\n\nJust Cause Eviction Protections\nJust cause eviction laws require landlords to have a \u201cjust cause\u201d to evict a tenant, such as violating the terms of the lease.\nIn Oregon, SB 608 (2019) limits no-cause evictions for renters who have lived in their home for at least a year. Landlords may end a lease if the tenant violated the lease terms or for one of four \u201clandlord-based\u201d reasons defined in statute. Landlords must pay tenants relocation assistance. The law does not apply to owner-occupied properties with two units or less.\n\n\nSource of Income Protections\nThe practice of refusing to rent to someone with a tenant-based subsidy\u2014like a Housing Choice Voucher\u2014is known as \u201csource of income discrimination.\u201d These protections ban landlords from discriminating against applicants based on their source of income.\nAs of 2009, Miami-Dade County\u2019s civil and human rights ordinance of the County Code includes source of income\u2014including but not limited to Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers\u2014as a class protected from housing discrimination.\n\n\nBan the Box Policies\n\u201cBan the Box\u201d policies aim to reduce barriers to housing for people with criminal records. These policies prohibit landlords from considering an applicant\u2019s criminal record during tenant selection.\nSeattle\u2019s Fair Chance Housing Ordinance (2017) prohibits rental property owners from denying applicants housing based on their arrest record, conviction, or criminal history. The law does not apply to owner-occupied single-family dwellings or accessory dwelling units.\n\n\nRight to Counsel Laws\nRight to Counsel laws guarantee free legal representation to renters facing eviction. These laws aim to prevent unnecessary evictions by ensuring that low-income renters have access to representation during court proceedings.\nUnder New York City\u2019s Right-to-Counsel law (2017), tenants facing eviction in Housing Court or New York City Housing Authority administrative proceedings are guaranteed access to free legal representation and advice provided by nonprofit legal services organizations.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nLandlord awareness of different types of tenant protection laws varied substantially (Figure 2). Surveyed owners were most likely to be aware of rent control and stabilization laws\u2014only 5 percent reported that they were unsure whether the property surveyed was subject to some kind of rent control. Uncertainty was greater about other types of tenant protections. For example, 30 percent did not know whether source of income discrimination was prohibited. Moreover, 40 and 44 percent respectively did not know if the law banned examination of criminal records during tenant selection (Ban the Box) or guaranteed tenants legal representation during eviction proceedings (Right to Counsel).\nFigure 2. Presence of Tenant Protection Laws, as Reported by the Property Owner\nSource: 2022 Terner Center Survey.\nNote: Sample sizes range from 755 to 761, depending on the policy asked about.\nCompared to larger-scale owners, smaller-scale owners were less likely to know whether these policies applied to their properties (Figure 3). For example, 38 percent of landlords with the smallest portfolios (less than ten units) reported not knowing if the property surveyed was governed by a source of income discrimination law, compared to 16 percent of landlords with the largest portfolios (50 units or more). Nearly half of these smaller-scale landlords reported not knowing if there was a Ban the Box or Right to Counsel law in place.\nFigure 3. Owner Unaware if Policy Applied to Property Surveyed, by Portfolio Size\nSource: 2022 Terner Center Survey.\nNote: Sample sizes range from 686 to 692, depending on the policy asked about.\nIn addition to expressing uncertainty about which tenant protection laws are in place, landlords may sometimes be wrong about whether certain policies apply to their properties. To evaluate the accuracy of landlord awareness, we analyze the extent to which surveyed rental property owners in California knew whether their properties were covered by three types of tenant protection laws\u2014rent control or stabilization, just cause eviction, and source of income protections\u2014passed at the state level in 2019. Assembly Bill 1482 (2019) created a rent cap that limits the amount rent can increase year-over-year, and requires landlords to have a \u201cjust cause\u201d to evict tenants. Senate Bill 329 (2019) made it illegal for landlords to discriminate against tenants based on their source of income.\nOwners in California were more likely to know that they were subject to rent stabilization and just cause eviction policies than source of income protections (Figure 4). About 80 percent of respondents correctly identified the presence of these two protections; 14 percent reported incorrectly that the law did not set limits on rent changes for their property, and eight percent reported that no just cause eviction protections applied. An important caveat is that we were not able to assess whether landlords were specifically aware of AB 1482. Many jurisdictions in California have their own rent control and just cause eviction ordinances, and owner awareness of these protections may reflect knowledge of local protections, rather than AB 1482.\nFigure 4. Awareness of Tenant Protection Laws Among Owners of Properties Surveyed in California\nSource: 2022 Terner Center Survey. Notes: For rent control or stabilization and just cause eviction, data above excludes surveyed properties\u00a0 built after 1999. AB 1482 does not apply to properties built within the last 15 years. Sample sizes range from 246 to 254, depending on the policy asked about.\nOnly half (52 percent) of owners in California correctly reported the presence of source of income protections, as codified in 2019 by SB 329 (Figure 4). One in five incorrectly reported that no such policy applied to their property; another 28 percent did not know if such a policy existed. Among owners who either incorrectly reported that no source of income protection law applied or who did not know whether such a law existed, 44 percent said that they would not rent to a tenant with a Housing Choice Voucher. Research has shown that voucher holders successfully find housing more often in places with source of income protections. Landlord lack of knowledge undermines the effectiveness of these protections.\nEducation and proactive enforcement are critical for ensuring that renter rights are realized. Survey respondents\u2019 uncertainty about and unfamiliarity with tenant protections highlights the need for ongoing landlord education about their responsibilities under existing law. Given the fragmented nature of these laws and regulations, it can be challenging for property owners and tenants alike to stay up-to-date on the shifting landscape of protections in different cities and states. In some cases, reducing the patchwork of protections\u2014by limiting statutory carve-outs and exceptions, or defining new or expanded federal protections\u2014can help create a better baseline for renter rights. For example, prohibiting source of income discrimination at the federal level would eliminate ambiguity about policy coverage while also increasing fairness in rental search processes and effectiveness of tenant-based government subsidies, like the Housing Choice Voucher program, across the country.\nHowever, education and outreach alone may not always be sufficient. Having an enforcement agency with an audit or oversight role may be necessary to achieve robust compliance. Violations of tenant protection laws and housing discrimination against protected groups like people of color, sexual and gender minorities, and people with disabilities are notoriously difficult\u2014even for affected tenants\u2014to detect., In most situations, violations are only inspected if a tenant files a complaint, putting the burden on renters to ensure that their rights are enforced. Increasing the effectiveness of tenant protection policies will require accountability mechanisms, such as additional reporting requirements for landlords, better data infrastructure, and proactive enforcement strategies. Broadly, additional funding for and expanded access to legal services is also needed to ensure that tenant protection laws are enforced, that legal proceedings are fair, and that unnecessary evictions are avoided.\n\n",

    "content": "\n\nA new UC Berkeley study reveals impacts of new construction, rent stabilization and just-cause evictions on displacement in the Bay Area. (Photo by Mike McBey via Flickr)\n\nNew research from UC Berkeley will provide lawmakers with previously unavailable data that pinpoint the impact that new housing production, rent stabilization and just-cause eviction policies have on residential displacement.\nThe study, \u201cHousing Market Interventions and Residential Mobility in the San Francisco Bay Area,\u201d was released this week by Berkeley\u2019s Urban Displacement Project, in collaboration with the Changing Cities Research Lab at Stanford University and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The research has major implications for California\u2019s housing crisis, which is experiencing a shortfall in housing production that will reach 1.5 million units by 2025, said Karen Chapple, Urban Displacement Project director and professor emerita of city and regional planning at Berkeley.\n\u201cDisplacement disrupts lives and livelihoods, often forcing people to move far from their jobs, schools and communities,\u201d said Chapple, who is also director at the School of Cities at the University of Toronto. \u201cThe effects are devastating and can be long-lasting, so even one displaced family is one too many.\u201d\nThe new study uses granular data on displacement in the Bay Area, and by examining the socio-economic status of households that are displaced, identifies how housing policies, like market rate and subsidized development and tenant protections, impact displacement over a four-year period.\nThe study focused on the nine-county Bay Area. Key findings for the study include:\n\nNeighborhoods where new market rate housing is built see an increase in rates of displacement for very low-to-moderate socio-economic groups at 0.5% to 2% above normal rates.\nMore market rate housing construction primarily serves the most affluent \u2014 these residents are the least likely to move out and the most likely to move into neighborhoods with new construction.\nFor all socioeconomic groups, market rate construction is associated with a slightly higher chance of making a move to a lower-opportunity neighborhood.\nRent stabilization helps residents of the lowest socioeconomic status stay in their neighborhoods, but it also prevents other low-income people from moving in.\nJust-cause eviction protections help the lowest socioeconomic status residents remain in gentrifying neighborhoods where displacement pressures may be especially strong for vulnerable residents. In these hot market areas, just cause can reduce the likelihood of displacement by up to 1% for the lowest income residents. But these protections do not encourage new low-income residents to move in.\nRenters make fewer downward moves from neighborhoods where more units are covered by just-cause protections \u2014 suggesting people are able to make planned moves.\n\n\u201cTo address the housing affordability crisis and mitigate displacement and exclusion, California\u2019s leaders must pursue not only the preservation of unsubsidized affordable housing, but also bolder initiatives that substantially expand social housing \u2014 rental or homeownership units made affordable at a moderate income or below, run by a public or nonprofit entity,\u201d Chapple said. \u201cMatching the urgency of the housing crisis will require wide implementation and investment.\u201d\n\n",

    "content": "\n\nDark purple areas of Alameda County show where 1,600 people or more moved.\u00a0 (Urban Displacement Project map)\n\nNew reports from the Urban Displacement Project at UC Berkeley and the California Housing Partnership confirm that rising housing costs between 2000 and 2015 have contributed to displacement of low-income people of color and resulted in new concentrations of poverty and racial segregation in the Bay Area.\nIncreases in housing prices have intensified racial disparities in access to neighborhoods with better environmental quality, educational resources and economic opportunities, increasingly placing these neighborhoods out of reach for low-income people of color in San Francisco, Alameda and Contra Costa counties.\n\u201cOur research provides quantitative evidence of what activists have been saying for years: The housing crisis is contributing to the re-segregation of the Bay Area,\u201d says Miriam Zuk, director of the\u00a0Urban Displacement Project.\nFor example, the reports found that low-income black households became increasingly likely to live in high-poverty, segregated neighborhoods between 2000 and 2015. In 2015, 65 percent of San Francisco\u2019s low-income black households lived in high-poverty, segregated neighborhoods\u2014a substantially higher rate than low-income groups of other races. Low-income families living in these types of neighborhoods typically face greater barriers to economic mobility and are more likely to suffer adverse health outcomes.\n\u201cThese reports provide clear evidence that low-income people of color in the Bay Area suffer the most as housing prices rise and displacement pushes them into higher-poverty, lower-resource neighborhoods where the odds are stacked against them,\u201d says Matt Schwartz, president and CEO of the\u00a0California Housing Partnership. \u201cWe can and must do better.\u201d\nCounties and cities in the Bay Area need policies and investments that support housing affordability, stability, and greater access to high-resource neighborhoods for low-income people of color. To be successful, these policies and investments must account for both the historic legacies of racial segregation as well as recent trends in re-segregation documented in these reports.\n\u201cAs these reports highlight, the housing crisis continues to hit low-income residents of color particularly hard, forcing residents out of their homes and contributing to the resegregation of the Bay Area,\u201d said Fred Blackwell, CEO of the San Francisco Foundation. \u201cWe cannot make meaningful progress toward inclusive prosperity in the region without addressing the housing crisis.\u201d\nKey findings from the reports:\n\nBetween 2000 and 2015, as housing prices rose, the City of Richmond, the Bayview in San Francisco and flatlands areas of Oakland and Berkeley lost thousands of low-income black households. Meanwhile, increases in low-income black households during the same period were concentrated in cities and neighborhoods with lower housing prices\u2014such as Antioch and Pittsburg in eastern Contra Costa County, as well parts of Hayward and the unincorporated communities of Ashland and Cherryland.\n\n\nLarge increases in the number of low-income people of color living in areas that became\u00a0newly\u00a0segregated and high-poverty between 2000 and 2015\u2014such as in the unincorporated communities of Ashland and Cherryland in Alameda County and in cities in East Contra Costa County\u2014are evidence that rising housing costs and migration patterns have contributed to new concentrations of segregation and poverty in the region.\n\n\nLow-income households of color were much more vulnerable than low-income white households to the impact of rapid increases in housing prices. In the Bay Area, a 30 percent tract-level increase in median rent paid between 2000 and 2015 was associated with a 43 percent decrease in low-income households of color and a 7 percent decrease in low-income white households.\n\n\nLow-income households who made any kind of move in 2015\u2014whether they stayed within their county of origin or left it\u2014ended up paying a higher share of their income on rent than those who did not move, a clear indicator of the high cost of displacement.\n\n\nUpon moving, a significant share of low-income people of all races not only left their county of origin but the region altogether. For example, 40 percent of low-income black households in Alameda County who moved in 2015 left the Bay Area, another indication of regional displacement pressures.\n\n\n",

    "content": "\n\u00a0\nWhat You Need to Know:\u00a0\n#1 Rent increases are capped at 5% plus the cost of inflation - in total around 7 or 8% this year. The exact rent cap depends on the regional Consumer Price Index (CPI)\u00a0but in no case can a rent increase exceed 10%, even if\u00a0inflation is high.\n#2 After you\u2019ve lived in your home for 1 year, landlords cannot evict you without a \u201cjust cause\u201d - that means they can\u2019t just arbitrarily push you out to make more money.\u00a0They have to provide a reason - like failure to pay rent or vandalizing the property. Here are some examples of\u00a0\u00a0\u201cJust Causes\u201d for eviction:\u00a0\n\nFailure to pay rent\nContinued violation of a part of the lease\nDoing significant damage to the property\nUsing the building for illegal purposes\nIf the landlord wants to move into the property. In this case, or in other \"no fault\" eviction cases, the tenant is due one month's rent as a relocation assistance payment.\nEtc. for more information click here for an item by item description of your rights under just cause.\n\n#3 The law goes into effect on January 1st, 2020. But if you were given a rent increase above the rent cap between March 15th 2019 and January 1st 2020, your landlord is required to lower the increase to the rent cap standard\u00a0no later than\u00a0January 1, 2020.\n#4\u00a0\u00a0Some\u00a08 Million renters in California who have NEVER had rent protections before will be protected by the law.\u00a0However, not all units are covered.\u00a0Without getting into the boring nitty gritty of it, here are some of the main exemptions you should know about:\u00a0\n\n\nBuildings less than 15 years old are not covered.\u00a0 As buildings age, and cross the 15 year threshold, they will be covered\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you live in a single family home that IS NOT owned by a corporation, you are not covered, and IF your landlord has given you notice that the home is exempt. \u00a0\nIf you live in a single family that IS owned by a corporation, you ARE covered.\nIf you live in a duplex and your landlord lives in one of the units, you ARE NOT covered.\n\n#5 Do you live in a city that already has rent control? The Tenant Protection Act of 2019 plugs some loopholes in our local rent control ordinances.\u00a0If you already have rent control this doesn\u2019t change it! You get to keep the same good old renter protections you\u2019ve already had.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor example: If you live in a city that has rent control (like Oakland, San Francisco or Los Angeles County), but you are denied protections by the Costa Hawkins Rental Housing Act (remember Prop 10?) because you live in newer building or a single family home - the Tenant Protection Act may cover you! For instance, if you live in a building built after 1978 in Los Angeles, Costa Hawkins denies you the benefits of rent control, BUT the Tenant Protection Act does extend the rent cap to all buildings built before 2014... Meaning there\u2019s thousands more Angelenos that will now have protections!\n\nThe Tenant Protection Act is not a silver bullet to resolve California\u2019s displacement crisis but it is what renters had the power to win this year.

    "content": "\nAB 1482 - California Tenant Protection Act\nThe maximum rent increase for units under AB 1482 is currently 8.8% (effective from August 1, 2024 to July 31, 2025) for Alameda.\nThe cap will be 6.3% effective August 1, 2025, through July 31, 2026.\nWhat is AB 1482?\nAB 1482\u00a0, also known as the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, is a California state law that establishes statewide protections for renters, including:\n\nRent Increase Limits: Caps annual rent increases at 5% plus the local Consumer Price Index (CPI), or 10%, whichever is lower.\nJust Cause Eviction Protections: Requires landlords to provide a valid reason for terminating a tenancy after 12 months of occupancy.\n\nHow Does AB 1482 Interact with Alameda's Rent Ordinance\u00a0?\nAB 1482 specifically states that it does not affect the authority of local jurisdictions like Alameda to adopt or maintain their own limits on rent increases for multi-unit properties built before February 1, 1995, as well as just-cause provisions that apply to all rental properties in Alameda.\nThe Rent Ordinance permits the Rent Program to enforce AB 1482\u2019s rent increase limits consistent with authority granted under state law to the City Attorney\u2019s Office.\nThe Alameda City Council has found that the Rent Ordinance\u2019s just cause provisions are more protective of tenants\u2019 rights than AB 1482\u2019s just cause provisions, so the Rent Ordinance\u2019s provisions apply to all tenancies.\nWhich Properties Are Covered?\nIn Alameda, the following rental units are subject to AB 1482\u2019s rent increase limits even though they are exempt from Alameda\u2019s local limits:\n\nProperties with three or more units\n\n- All units built after February 1, 1995, but more than 15 years ago. This applies on a rolling basis. (For example, a unit constructed on January 1, 2006 is exempt as of January 1, 2020, but becomes covered by AB 1482 protections on and after January 1, 2021.)\n- All units built after February 1, 1995, but more than 15 years ago, provided the other unit has not been occupied by an owner of the property for the entire period of the tenancy.\n\nSingle-family homes and condominiums\n\n- All units built more than 15 years ago, if either of the following apply:\n\nThe property is owned by a corporation, Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), and/or an LLC with at least one corporate member, OR\nA non-corporate owner failed to provide the tenant with a written notice of exemption using legally required language (see below).\n\nNotice Requirements\nFor all tenants in units covered by AB 1482:\nA written notice must be given explaining AB 1482\u2019s rent increase and eviction protections:\n\nBefore August 1, 2020 (for tenancies existing before July 1, 2020), or\nAt the start of tenancy (for leases signed or renewed on or after July 1, 2020), either as an addendum or a separate written notice signed by the tenant.\n\nRequired Language:\n\u201cCalifornia law limits the amount your rent can be increased. See Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code for more information. California law also provides that after all of the tenants have continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 12 months or more or at least one of the tenants has continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 24 months or more, a landlord must provide a statement of cause in any notice to terminate a tenancy. See Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code for more information.\u201d\nFor exempt single-family homes and condominiums:\nIf an owner claims exemption from AB 1482 based on the property being a single-family home or condo, the following notice must be included in the lease (for tenancies beginning or renewed on or after July 1, 2020):\nRequired Language:\n\u201cThis property is not subject to the rent limits imposed by Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code and is not subject to the just cause requirements of Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code. This property meets the requirements of Sections 1947.12 (d)(5) and 1946.2 (e)(8) of the Civil Code and the owner is not any of the following: (1) a real estate investment trust, as defined by Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code; (2) a corporation; or (3) a limited liability company in which at least one member is a corporation.\u201d\nWhat Are the Rent Increase Limits Under AB 1482?\n\nUnder AB 1482, annual rent increases are limited to\u00a05% plus the local\u00a0Consumer Price Index (CPI), or\u00a010%, whichever is lower. These limits apply to rent increases effective between August 1 and July 31 of the following year.\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective Period\n\n\nCPI (%)\n\n\nAB 1482 Increase Cap\n\n\n\n\nAugust 1, 2025 \u2013 July 31, 2026\n\n\n1.3\n\n\n6.3\n\n\n\n\nAugust 1, 2024 \u2013 July 31, 2025\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n8.8\n\n\n\n\nAugust 1, 2023 \u2013 July 31, 2024\n\n\n4.2\n\n\n9.2\n\n\n\n\nAugust 1, 2022 \u2013 July 31, 2023\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n\n\nAugust 1, 2021 \u2013 July 31, 2022\n\n\n3.8\n\n\n8.8\n\n\n\n\nAugust 1, 2020 \u2013 July 31, 2021\n\n\n1.1\n\n\n6.1\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1, 2020 \u2013 July 31, 2020\n\n\n4.0\n\n\n9.0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFor Alameda, the local CPI is defined as the percentage change from April 1 of the prior year to April 1 of the current year in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for All Items (CPI-U) for the San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward metropolitan area.\nAre Duplexes in Alameda Exempt from Rent Control?\nIt depends mainly on the year of construction. Alameda\u2019s local limit on rent increases, the Annual General Adjustment, applies to all properties with at least two units on a legal lot of record built before February 1, 1995. This covers most duplexes in Alameda.\nFor duplexes built after February 1, 1995, but more than 15 years ago, AB 1482\u2019s limit on rent increases applies unless the other unit has been occupied by an owner of the property for entire period of the tenancy.\nDo Units That Are Exempt from AB 1482 Still Need to be Registered with the Alameda Rent Program?\nYes. The Alameda Rent Ordinance requires the registration of all rental units, regardless of AB 1482\u2019s exemption allowances. Rental units that are not subject to Alameda\u2019s local limit on rent increases are considered \u201cpartially regulated\u201d and are still subject to the local just-cause provisions, certain registration requirements(PDF,\u00a0200KB), and a reduced annual program fee.\n\n\u00a0\n\n",

    "content": "What is rent control in California?The California rent control law, also known as the California Tenant Protection Act of 2019 or CA AB 1482, is a law that limits rent increases for residential rental properties in California. The law, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, applies to properties built more than 15 years ago (applied on a rolling basis) that are not covered by other local rent control ordinances.Under the law, landlords are generally limited to increasing rent by no more than 5% plus local inflation per year or 10%, whichever is lower. The law also includes other provisions to protect tenants, such as a ban on \"no-fault\" evictions (not based on the tenant's actions or behavior) and a requirement that landlords have a valid reason for evicting a tenant.California is not alone when it comes to rental affordability challenges caused by rising rents. Recent estimates from the Census Bureau point to over 40%, or 19 million, of renter households being \u201ccost burdened\u201d by housing expenses \u2013 spending more than 30% of their income on housing costs. As this number has climbed, so has the political pressure in many areas for new policies to support renters.The California rent control law has been controversial since it was passed, with some arguing that it is necessary to protect renters from excessive rent increases and others arguing that it will discourage new investment in rental properties and lead to a decrease in the quality of rental housing.The unintended consequences of rent controlLaws that impose rent caps and other forms of rent control are meant to protect renters from excessive rent increases. Still, they can have unintended consequences on real estate valuations, markets, and the community's well-being.Valuation impactsOne potential impact of rent caps is that they can reduce the value of rental properties. Because landlords are limited in the amount of rent, they can charge, decreased gross potential revenue can translate into lower valuations. However, this is mainly dependent on how restrictive the rent caps are.Investment impactsAnother potential impact of rent caps is that they may discourage new investment in rental properties. Landlords may be less likely to purchase or maintain rental properties if they cannot charge market-based rents. This could lead to either a decrease in the supply of rental properties and/or a decline in the quality of the existing stock. A decrease in the overall supply could drive up rent prices in the long run, while a reduction in the current stock could decrease the quality of life for the renters.Renter's benefit, but not without a costOverall, the impact of rent caps on real estate valuations and markets is complex and multifaceted. Many research studies have analyzed this topic over the years, only to find that the impact and effectiveness of these types of policies depend on the perspective from which effectiveness is being judged. For example, some recent papers have shown how rent control policies help increase tenant well-being and promote economic stability for renters but decrease market supply and contribute to increased market rents.What other markets have imposed similar restrictions?There have been many cities and states in the United States that have introduced rent caps since 2010. Some examples include:Oregon: In 2019, Oregon passed Senate bill 608, a statewide rent control law that allows cities to implement rent caps on properties over 15 years old.New York, NY: In 2019, New York City passed Senate bill S6458, a rent control law that limits rent increases for rent-stabilized apartments to 2.5% per year.Washington, D.C.: In 2020, the District of Columbia introduced a temporary rent control law that limits rent increases to 2% per year for properties with a rental license.These are just a few examples of rent caps introduced in the United States in recent years. It is worth noting that rent control policies vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and many other cities and states have implemented similar policies.Where does California rent control go from here?Ultimately, due to the high limit, the impact of AB 1482 has been less pronounced in valuations. With the cap being the lower of 5% plus local inflation or 10%, the immediate value impact has been insignificant as appraisers typically do not model projected rent growth at that level.In the case of renovations, a valuation may see notable rent increases year-over-year, but these increases are due to rent premiums from these unit renovations and are not restricted by this rent control law.While the immediate impact of this law may not be pronounced, there may still be long-term effects. In recent quarters, some markets have experienced very strong fundamentals, and the rent control law has limited their current rental rates. Assuming the strong fundamentals persist, the recent California rent control law may result in prolonged periods of positive but slower rent growth as building owners capture increased market rents later in the cash flow for properties in higher-growth markets.Recently city councils are facing increasing pressure from tenant groups to pass even more restrictive caps on tenant increases. With inflation at a 40-year high, more than 1.3 million California households report being behind on rent payments. City councils, including Antioch, Oakland and Santa Monica, reduced the rent increase cap to 3%, while Pomona and Bell Gardens limited increases to 4%.An alternative to rent control lawsAt a time when property owners are facing rising operating costs, pressure to cap rent increases below the rate of inflation may lead to further declines in the maintenance of rent-controlled housing stock. It may be time for cities to consider incentives for developers to provide new affordable housing rather than imposing additional restrictions on the existing stock.",

    "title": "Understanding Rent Control States: Balancing Housing Affordability and Landlord Profitability - Azibo",
    "content": "Rent is a major expense for millions of Americans, and in recent years, the cost of housing has been on the rise. In 2021, average rent across the country rose by over 18%, although it has stabilized since then, with rent increases softening in 2023. To help keep housing affordable for tenants and still allow property owners to make a reasonable profit, some states have implemented rent control laws that limit how much landlords can increase rent.Rent control is a controversial topic, with supporters arguing that it prevents huge rent hikes that could price tenants out of their homes, while critics claim that rent control discourages new construction, potentially leading to housing shortages.Given the significant impact rent control laws have on the overall housing market, it's important to understand how these policies work in different states across the country. This article explores how these laws came about, what the rules cover, and how they affect residents and property owners.Federal rent control lawsThe United States doesn't have a federal rent control law that sets rent prices across the country. Instead, state and local governments decide on rent control policies. The federal government did have temporary rent controls in place after World War II due to housing shortages at that time, but they eventually lifted these measures.The federal government offers programs to help make rent more affordable for certain groups, such as low-income families and those with disabilities. One such program is Section 8 housing, where local housing authorities determine if a household qualifies based on their income being below 50% of the area's median income level.Under Section 8, qualified households receive rental vouchers that they can use with private landlords. These vouchers cover a portion of the rent while the tenant pays the remaining amount. Landlords have the option to voluntarily accept or decline these Section 8 vouchers.How do state and local rent control laws work?The implementation and enforcement of rent control laws vary depending on the state and local jurisdiction, with some states banning rent control altogether while others allow local governments to establish their own policies.State rent control policiesCurrently, 33 states have banned cities and counties from establishing any rent control measures. But, as housing affordability gains more attention, local governments are pushing back on preemption laws.This leaves 17 states, along with the District of Columbia, that either permit rent control or do not have specific laws prohibiting it. In these areas, the approach to rent control can vary significantly, from comprehensive statewide policies to more localized regulations within certain cities or counties. States like California, New York, and Oregon have prominent rent control laws that offer various degrees of regulation.Local implementation and administrationFor states that permit rent control, it's up to their local governments to implement and administer the rent regulations through their own rent boards or commissions. The specific rules can vary between cities.In places with rent control, landlords need approval from the local rent board before raising rents above certain amounts or terminating leases. A rent increase letter informing tenants of an approved rent hike must follow proper procedures created by the rent board.Rent control vs. rent stabilizationRent stabilization is a form of rent control ordinance, but it's different from rent control in terms of its flexibility and broader applicability.Applicability and coverage: Rent stabilization typically applies to a larger number of housing units than rent control. Unlike rent control, which often covers older units with specific historical criteria, rent stabilization can include newer buildings and is more widespread in jurisdictions that adopt it.Annual rent increases: A key difference lies in the management of rent increases. Instead of setting strict limits on rent hikes, stabilization permits annual increases based on a percentage determined by a local rent board or similar governing body.Investment incentives: Rent stabilization often includes provisions that encourage landlords to maintain and improve their properties. Landlords may be able to apply for larger rent growth to cover significant renovations or upgrades. This helps make sure that buildings stay in good repair and that the housing stock does not deteriorate.Tenant protections: Rent stabilization still provides strong protection for tenants. This includes the right to renew leases and limitations on eviction designed to provide housing stability and predictability.States with rent control lawsHere's an overview of rent control policies in a few different states:CaliforniaWhen it comes to rent control, California is unique compared to most other states. There's a statewide law, but cities can also add their own stricter local rent control rules on top of that.State lawIn 2019, California passed a law that limits annual rent increases to 5% plus inflation based on the regional Consumer Price Index.So, if inflation is 3%, the maximum rent increase would be 8% for that year. However, this statewide limit doesn't apply to newer buildings less than 15 years old or single-family homes owned by individuals rather than corporations. This law expires in 2030 unless extended.Local rent control measuresWhat makes California stand apart from other states is that it allows cities to adopt even stricter local rent control laws than the statewide limit. Cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, and others have their own local rent control rules. The local laws are comprehensive, like requiring a valid reason for evictions or putting tight limits on rent growth between tenants.The details can differ from one city's rules to the next. So, as a landlord in California, you have to follow the statewide rent cap while also potentially facing additional rent control rules from your local city. It makes for a complex set of regulations.There are efforts by tenant groups to strengthen rent control further across California, but statewide ballot initiatives to do so have failed to pass in recent years. For now, it remains a combination of statewide and local policies.District of ColumbiaD.C. has had strict rent control rules in place since 1985. Under D.C.'s rent control, there are rules that landlords must follow for rent increases. Landlords can only raise the rent once per year on rent-controlled units, and mid-year increases are not allowed.Those annual rent hikes are limited based on inflation. In most cases, the maximum increase permitted is 2% plus the inflation rate for that year. However, governments strictly cap rent increases at 5% annually for elderly or disabled tenants, no matter the inflation.So, D.C.'s rent control creates modest rent increases tied to inflation rather than allowing big jumps. As a landlord, you can't raise the rent by whatever amount you'd like in a given year.Between the rent increase caps and eviction protections, D.C.'s rent control aims to provide stability and predictability for both tenants and landlords about pricing and turnover of rental units. It's considered one of the strictest rent control systems in the country.MarylandMaryland doesn't have statewide rent control policies. Instead, it allows local jurisdictions like counties and cities to implement their own rent control measures. Areas in the Baltimore metro region have taken that route, especially for designated affordable housing communities.One example is the city of Takoma Park, which has established rent control regulations limiting property owners to one rent increase per year. In addition, these annual rent increases are capped and tied directly to the regional Consumer Price Index for inflation for that year.So, if inflation is running at 3% based on CPI data, then the maximum you could raise the rent is 3% for that year's increase. The city publishes the allowable rent adjustment percentage every spring once the latest inflation numbers are available.While not every city or county in Maryland has the same rent control rules, the regulations in places like Takoma Park demonstrate the impact of local rent control ordinances.MassachusettsMassachusetts has a unique history when it comes to rent control, with a period of implementation followed by a repeal and a shift toward local policies. In 1970, Massachusetts implemented rent control rules, but voters repealed them through a public vote in 1994.Today, Massachusetts does not have broad rent control policies at the state level. A few municipalities, like Cambridge, still have their own local rent control rules. But for the most part, rent regulation is no longer a major factor across Massachusetts like it once was.New JerseyIn New Jersey, there is no statewide rent control policy. Instead, the state allows municipalities to establish their own local rent control laws. Over 100 cities and towns throughout New Jersey have implemented some form of rent control within their borders, with rules and regulations varying from one locale to another.Some cities may have basic rent increase limits, while others have more comprehensive rent control measures. As a tenant or landlord, it's best to check directly with your local city or town hall for the specific details of any rent control ordinance that applies to your area.New YorkNew York has some of the oldest and most extensive rent control policies in the country, with the system in New York City dating back to the 1920s.Traditional rent controlIn NYC, traditional rent control applies to residential buildings constructed before February 1947 where the same tenant or their family has been continuously living since 1971. The city sets a maximum base rent for these units, which is adjusted every two years to account for changes in operating costs for the landlord.When a rent-controlled tenant or their family moves out, the unit becomes either rent-stabilized under different rules or deregulated entirely, depending on the situation.Rent stabilization programThe rent stabilization program covers many more residential properties in NYC built before 1974. It's not as restrictive as rent control, but it still limits how much landlords can increase rent each year through set percentages.Rent regulation outside New York CityNew York state law permits other counties and municipalities to have their own rent regulation programs modeled on these NYC systems if they meet certain criteria around housing supply.Rent control remains a significant factor across many parts of New York, especially in the city's older housing stock. The debate between landlords and tenants has been ongoing for decades, with landlords arguing it stops investment and development while tenants say it promotes affordable housing access.OregonOregon made national news in 2019 when it became the first state to implement statewide rent control laws, limiting how much landlords can increase rents each year.Every September, officials recalculate the permitted rent increase percentage based on inflation data, typically setting it at around 7% plus the inflation rate over the prior 12 months. For example, if inflation were 3% for that year, the maximum rent increase allowed would be 10%.There are some exceptions to the rent cap, though. For example, it doesn't cover any units that are part of the government's affordable housing programs or newer rental properties that are less than 15 years old.How do rent control laws affect landlords and property owners?Rent control laws can challenge landlords and property owners in managing their rental business. Here are some of the key issues they face:Limited rent increases: One of the biggest problems is that rent control laws strictly limit how much you can raise the rent for tenants, even if your costs for taxes, maintenance, repairs, and utilities keep rising year after year. This can make it hard to keep up with increasing expenses, especially in areas with high inflation.Approval for improvements: Let's say you want to renovate or upgrade your rental property. Under most rent control, you need approval from the rent board before increasing rent to cover the costs of those improvements. Getting that approval can be difficult.Can't adjust to market rates: When a long-term tenant moves out, you may want to adjust the rent to current market rates in your area. Some rent control prevents you from doing that, and you must stay at the current rate, even if the rent for similar units is much higher.Rent boards may not understand: The people on rent control boards are typically community members, not real estate experts. Their decisions on rent increases may not account for the real challenges and financial realities landlords face as property owners.Extra fees: Aside from existing property taxes and expenses, many rent control programs charge landlords additional fees to fund the rent regulation system. So, not only do the laws limit rent increases and profits, but they add an extra financial burden.Legal and administrative complexities: The complexity of rent control laws across different jurisdictions creates a learning curve and potential legal pitfalls for landlords. Managing these complexities may require legal counsel.Impact on housing supply and development: There's a broader economic argument that rent control could deter new construction or the conversion of existing properties into rental units. This could potentially worsen housing shortages in areas with high demand and stifle the growth and diversification of the housing market.Tenant perspectives on rent controlUnderstanding tenant perspectives can provide insight into how these regulations impact those they aim to protect. Here are some key areas to consider:Affordability and stability: Rent control can make housing more affordable for tenants, enabling them to live in areas they might otherwise find too expensive. It also provides stability, helping families plan their finances without fear of unexpected rent increases.Protection from displacement: Especially in fast-growing cities, rent control can protect tenants from being displaced due to rising rents.Quality of housing concerns: Some tenants worry that rent control might discourage landlords from maintaining or improving properties, potentially leading to a decline in housing quality over time.Access to housing: Rent control can make certain apartments more affordable, but it can also lead to a tighter housing market, making it harder for new tenants to find rent-controlled units. This can inadvertently raise prices in the non-rent-controlled sector.States with rent controlRent control is a complex issue with both pros and cons. Supporters say it protects tenants from excessive rent increases and keeps housing affordable. Critics argue it discourages new housing construction and investment.The decision to have rent control laws is up to policymakers and the communities they represent. They must consider the potential benefits and drawbacks, looking at local housing markets, economic factors, and the needs of both tenants and landlords.Approaches to rent control vary widely across the United States. Some states have statewide rent control policies, while others allow local governments to implement their own rent regulations. Meanwhile, many states have no rent control measures at all.Ultimately, the effectiveness of rent control policies depends on various factors and may differ from one location to another. As housing affordability continues to be a pressing issue in many parts of the country, the debate surrounding rent control is likely to remain a topic of discussion among policymakers, housing advocates, and the general public.Rent control cities FAQsWhat states have banned rent control?Several states have banned rent control policies, allowing landlords to increase rents without restrictions. Among these states are Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, and Florida. Meanwhile, several other states have not taken a stance on rent control, leaving the decision to local jurisdictions.How many states have passed legislation prohibiting rent control?According to data from the National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC), around 30 states have passed laws that either prohibit or limit rent control policies in some way.What is the most a landlord can raise rent?There's no federal law limiting how much landlords can raise rent. In states without rent control, landlords can increase rent as much as they want when a lease is up for renewal.In places with rent control or rent stabilization policies, there are caps on how much rent can go up each year; 3-5% in many cases.",

    "content": "\nSteadily rising housing rents in many of the US\u2019s large, productive cities have reignited the discussion whether to expand or enact rent control provisions. Under pressure to fight rising rents, state lawmakers in Illinois, Oregon, and California are considering repealing laws that limit cities\u2019 abilities to pass or expand rent control. While rules and regulations of rent control vary from place to place, most rent control consists of caps on price increases within the duration of a tenancy, and sometimes beyond the duration of a tenancy, as well as restrictions on eviction.\nNew research examining how rent control affects tenants and housing markets offers insight into how rent control affects markets. While rent control appears to help current tenants in the short run, in the long run it decreases affordability, fuels gentrification, and creates negative spillovers on the surrounding neighborhood.\nA substantial body of economic research has used theoretical arguments to highlight the potential negative efficiency consequences to keeping rents below market rates, going back to Friedman and Stigler (1946). They argued that a cap on rents would lead landlords to sell their rental properties to owner occupants so that landlords could still earn the market price for their real estate. Rent control can also lead to \u201cmis-match\u201d between tenants and rental units. Once a tenant has secured a rent-controlled apartment, he may not choose to move in the future and give up his rent control, even if his housing needs change (Suen 1980, Glaeser and Luttmer 2003, Sims 2011, Bulow and Klemperer 2012). This mis-allocation can lead to empty-nest households living in family-sized apartments and young families crammed into small studios, clearly an inefficient allocation. Similarly, if rental rates are below market rates, renters may choose to consume excessive quantities of housing (Olsen 1972, Gyourko and Linneman 1989). Rent control can also lead to decay of the rental housing stock; landlords may not invest in maintenance because they can\u2019t recoup these investment by raising rents. (Downs 1988, Sims 2007).\nOf course, rent control also offered potential benefits for tenants. For example, rent control provides insurance against rent increases, potentially limiting displacement. Affordable housing advocates argue that these insurance benefits are valuable to tenants. For instance, if long-term tenants have developed neighborhood-specific capital, such as a network of friends and family, proximity to a job, or children enrolled in local schools, then tenants face large risks from rent appreciation. In contrast, individuals who have little connection to any specific area can easily insure themselves against local rental price appreciation by moving to a cheaper location. Those invested in the local community are not able to use this type of \u201cself-insurance\u201d as easily, since they must give up some or all of their neighborhood specific capital. Rent control can provide these tenants with this type of insurance.\nUntil recently, there was little data or natural experiments with which to assess the importance of these competing arguments, and to assess how rent controls affects tenants, landlords, or the broader housing market. But newly-available housing-market data spanning periods of dramatic change in rent control laws in Cambridge, MA and in San Francisco, CA have allowed economists to examine these questions empirically. While these studies do find support for the idea that existing tenants benefit from the insurance provided by rent control, they also find the overall cost of providing that insurance is very large.\nFrom December 1970 through 1994, all rental units in Cambridge built prior to 1969 were regulated by a rent control ordinance that placed strict caps on rent increases and tightly restricted the removal of units from the rental stock. The legislative intent of the rent control ordinance was to provide affordable rental housing, and at the eve of rent control\u2019s elimination in 1994, controlled units typically rented at 40-plus percent below the price of nearby non-controlled properties. In November 1994, the Massachusetts electorate passed a referendum to eliminate rent control by a narrow 51\u201349 percent margin, with nearly 60 percent of Cambridge residents voting to retain the rent control ordinance. This law change directly impacted properties previously subject to rent control, enabling landlords to begin to charge market rents.\nAutor, Palmer, and Pathak (2014) (APP), studies the impact of this unexpected change and find that newly decontrolled properties\u2019 market values increased by 45 percent.\u00a0 In addition to these direct effects of rent decontrol, APP find removing rent control has substantial indirect effects on neighboring properties, boosting their values too. Post-decontrol price appreciation was significantly greater at properties that had a larger fraction of formerly controlled neighbors: residential properties at the 75th percentile of rent control exposure gained approximately 13\u00a0percent more in property value following decontrol than did properties at the 25th percentile of exposure. This differential appreciation of properties in rent control\u2013intensive locations was\u00a0equally pronounced among decontrolled and never-controlled units, suggesting that the effect of rent control had been to reduce the whole neighborhood\u2019s desirability.\nThe economic magnitude of the effect of rent control removal on the value of Cambridge\u2019s housing stock is large, boosting property values by $2.0 billion between 1994 and 2004. Of this total effect, only $300 million is accounted for by the direct effect of decontrol on formerly controlled units, while $1.7 billion is due to the indirect effect. These estimates imply that more than half of the capitalized cost of rent control was borne by owners of never-controlled properties. Rent controlled properties create substantial negative externalities on the nearby housing market, lowering the amenity value of these neighborhoods and making them less desirable places to live. \u00a0In short, the policy imposed $2.0 billion in costs to local property owners, but only $300 million of that cost was transferred to renters in rent-controlled apartments.\nDiamond, McQuade, and Qian (2018) (DMQ) examine the consequences of an expansion of rent control on renters, landlords, and the housing market that resulted from a unique 1994 local San Francisco ballot initiative. In 1979, San Francisco imposed rent control on all standing buildings with five or more apartments. Rent control in San Francisco consists of regulated rent increases, linked to the CPI, within a tenancy, but no price regulation between tenants. New construction was exempt from rent control, since legislators did not want to discourage new development. Smaller multi-family buildings were exempt from this 1979 law change since they were viewed as more \u201cmom and pop\u201d ventures, and did not have market power over rents.\nThis exemption was lifted by a 1994 San Francisco ballot initiative. Proponents of the initiative argued that small multi-family housing was now primarily owned by large businesses and should face the same rent control of large multi-family housing. Since the initial 1979 rent control law only impacted properties built from 1979 and earlier, the removal of the small multi-family exemption also only affected properties built 1979 and earlier. This led to a differential expansion in rent control in 1994 based on whether the small multi-family housing was built prior to or post 1980\u2014a policy experiment where otherwise similar housing was treated differently by the law.\nTo examine rent control\u2019s effects on tenant migration and neighborhood choices, DMQ examine panel data that provides address-level migration decisions and housing characteristics for the majority of adults living in San Francisco in the early 1990s. This allows them to define a treatment group of renters who lived in small multi-family apartment buildings built prior to 1980 and a control group of renters living in small multi-family housing built between 1980 and 1990. Their data allows them to follow each of these groups over time up until the present, regardless of where they migrate.\nBetween five and ten years after the law change, the beneficiaries of rent control are 19 percent less likely to have moved to a new address, relative to the control group\u2019s migration rate. Further, impact on the likelihood of remaining in San Francisco as whole was the same, indicating a large share of the renters that rent control caused to remain at their 1994 address would have left San Francisco had they not been covered by rent control.\nThese effects are significantly stronger among older households and among households that have already spent a number of years at their address prior to treatment. This is consistent with the fact that both of these populations are likely to be less mobile. Renters who don\u2019t need to move very often are more likely to find it worthwhile to remain in their rent controlled apartment for a long time, enabling them to accrue larger rent savings. Finally, DMQ find these effects are especially large for racial minorities, likely indicating that minorities faced greater displacement pressures in San Francisco than whites.\nWhile expansion of rent control did prevent some displacement among tenants living in San Francisco in 1994, the landlords of these properties responded to mitigate their rental losses in a number of ways. In practice, landlords have a few possible ways of removing tenants. First, landlords could move into the property themselves, known as move-in eviction. Second, the Ellis Act allows landlords to evict tenants if they intend to remove the property from the rental market, for instance, in order to convert the units to condos. Finally, landlords are legally allowed to offer their tenants monetary compensation for leaving. In practice, these transfer payments from landlords are common and can be quite large.\nDMQ find that rent-controlled buildings were 8 percentage points more likely to convert to a condo than buildings in the control group. Consistent with these findings, they find that rent control led to a 15 percentage point decline in the number of renters living in treated buildings and a 25 percentage point reduction in the number of renters living in rent-controlled units, relative to 1994 levels. This large reduction in rental housing supply was driven by converting existing structures to owner-occupied condominium housing and by replacing existing structures with new construction.\nThis 15 percentage point reduction in the rental supply of small multi-family housing likely led to rent increases in the long-run, consistent with standard economic theory. In this sense, rent control operated as a transfer between the future renters of San Francisco (who would pay these higher rents due to lower supply) to the renters living in San Francisco in 1994 (who benefited directly from lower rents). Furthermore, since many of the existing rental properties were converted to higher-end, owner-occupied condominium housing and new construction rentals, the passage of rent control ultimately led to a housing stock that caters to higher income individuals. DMQ find that this high-end housing, developed in response to rent control, attracted residents with at least 18 percent higher income. Taking all of these points together, it appears rent control has actually contributed to the gentrification of San Francisco, the exact opposite of the policy\u2019s intended goal. Indeed, by simultaneously bringing in higher income residents and preventing displacement of minorities, rent control has contributed to widening income inequality of the city.\nIt may seem surprising that the expansion of rent control in San Francisco led to an upgraded housing stock, catering to high-income tastes, while the removal of rent control in Cambridge also lead to upgrading and value appreciation. To reconcile these effects, it is useful to think about which types of landlords would respond to a rent control expansion versus a rent control removal. In the case of rent control expansion, some landlords will choose to recoup some of their losses by converting to condo or redeveloping their building to exempt it from rent control. However, other landlords may choose to accept the rent control regulation, and no longer perform maintenance on the building and allow it to decay. In the rent control expansion case, one would see an increase in condo conversions and upgrades, driven by the landlords that chose to respond in this way. However, when rent control is removed, the landlords who own the rent controlled buildings are the ones who didn\u2019t choose to convert to condo or redevelop in response to the initial passage of rent control. Indeed, one would expect this subset of landlords to choose to upgrade and invest in their properties once the rent control regulation is removed.\nRent control appears to help affordability in the short run for current tenants, but in the long-run decreases affordability, fuels gentrification, and creates negative externalities on the surrounding neighborhood. These results highlight that forcing landlords to provide insurance to tenants against rent increases can ultimately be counterproductive. If society desires to provide social insurance against rent increases, it may be less distortionary to offer this subsidy in the form of a government subsidy or tax credit. This would remove landlords\u2019 incentives to decrease the housing supply and could provide households with the insurance they desire. A point of future research would be to design an optimal social insurance program to insure renters against large rent increases.\nThe authors did not receive any financial support from any firm or person for this article or from any firm or person with a financial or political interest in this article.

    "title": "'Unfairness' in consumer protection cases: the latest from the California Supreme Court",
    "content": "\n\nIn Capito v. San Jose Healthcare System, LP, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court addressed a perennial problem - the definition of an \"unfair\"\nbusiness practice under Business and Professions Code section 17200 (section 17200).\nCapito v. San Jose Healthcare System, LP (2024) 17 Cal.5th 273, 277-278\n(Capito).\nSection 17200 is California's analog to the Federal Trade\nCommission Act (FTCA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 41 et seq., which declares \"[u]nfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and\nunfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce\" to be unlawful.\nId., \u00a7 45(a)(1). Many states adopted such \"Little FTC Acts\" in the wake\nof the FTCA, and, like section 17200, authorized private individuals to bring\nenforcement actions. See Milner, From Rancid to Reasonable: Unfair\nMethods of Competition Under State Little FTC Acts (2024) 73 Am. U. L.Rev. 857, 879, 882 (hereafter Little FTC Acts). Ironically,\nCongress was so concerned about the unbridled enforcement of a potentially\nlimitless \"unfairness\" standard that it refused to permit a private right of\naction under the FTCA and limited the right of enforcement to the Federal Trade\nCommission. See Holloway v. Bristol-Myers Corp. (D.C. Cir. 1973)\n485 F.2d 986, 990 (Holloway) [\"[T]his breadth of prohibition\ncarried with it a danger that the statute might become a source of vexatious\nlitigation. Expertise was called for, both to identify trade practices that\nposed the threat of monopoly and to avoid using the statute as a vehicle for\ntrivial or frivolous claims. There was, furthermore, a need to develop a\ncentral and coherent body of precedent, construing and applying the statute in\na wide range of factual contexts, so as to define its\noperative reach.\"]; see also Little FTC Acts, supra, 73\nAm. U. L.Rev. at p. 867.\nLike the FTCA, section 17200 defines \"unfair competition\" to\nmean \"any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,\ndeceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.\" For many years, there was\nvirtually no limit to this wide-ranging statute, and plaintiffs could seek\nrelief for virtually any business practice regardless of normal rules governing\nequitable remedies. See Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn.\n(1972) 7 Cal.3d 94, 112 [interpreting Civil Code section 3369, the predecessor\nto Business and Professions Code section 17200: \"[T]he section was\nintentionally framed in its broad, sweeping language, precisely to enable\njudicial tribunals to deal with the innumerable 'new schemes which the\nfertility of man's invention would contrive' \"]. Individual\ncitizens could bring representative actions on behalf of the general\npublic based on a single transaction without regard to the requirements\nfor a class action and without showing that they themselves had been harmed by\nthe allegedly unfair practice. See, e.g., Kasky v. Nike, Inc.\n(2002) 27 Cal.4th 939, 949-951; Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores,\nInc. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 570; Committee On Children's Television,\nInc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 209-211; State Farm\nFire & Casualty Co. v. Superior Court (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1093,\n1102-1103; Hernandez v. Atlantic Finance Co. (1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 65,\n71-73.\nIn response to concerns over the breadth of section 17200, the\nvoters and the courts tightened the requirements for a section 17200 action. \nThrough a ballot initiative, the voters placed restrictions on section\n17200 actions. Proposition 64 required individuals (other than public\nprosecutors) to (a) satisfy the requirements for a class action in order to bring a representative action on behalf of the general\npublic, Bus. & Prof. Code, \u00a7 17203, and (b) demonstrate that they have\n\"suffered injury in fact and ha[ve] lost money or\nproperty as a result of the unfair competition.\" Bus. & Prof. Code, \u00a7\n17204. See Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310,\n320-322.\nIn Kraus v. Trinity Management Services, Inc., Kraus\nv. Trinity Management Services, Inc. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 116, 126-127. the\nCalifornia Supreme Court restricted the remedy of restitution in private\nsection 17200 enforcement actions to the \"return [of] money obtained through an\nunfair business practice to those persons ... from whom the property was taken,\nthat is, to persons who had an ownership interest in the property.\" Ibid. Kraus\nrejected the application in section 17200 actions of a \"fluid [fund]\nrecovery\" whereby a defendant disgorges into a fund money that is not to be\nreturned to the persons from whom it was obtained, untethered to the ownership\nof the property to be restored. Id. at p. 127.\nMost significantly for purposes of this article, the California\nSupreme Court, in Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone\nCo., restricted the definition of unfairness to competitors by adopting a\nsafe harbor rule: \"When a plaintiff who claims to have suffered injury from a\ndirect competitor's 'unfair' act or practice invokes section 17200, the word\n'unfair' in that section means conduct that threatens an incipient violation of\nan antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because\nits effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or\notherwise significantly threatens or harms competition.\" Cel-Tech\nCommunications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20\nCal.4th 163, 187 (Cel-Tech). Where the Cel-Tech safe harbor\napplies, the legislative authorization of or public policy favoring a business\npractice \"insulates\" that business practice from section 17200 liability. E.g.,\nMcCann v. Lucky Money, Inc. (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1382, 1387; Bernardo\nv. Planned Parenthood Federation of America (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 322,\n354; Schnall v. Hertz Corp. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1144, 1154, 1160-1161,\n1166 (Schnall).\nThe enduring issue after Cel-Tech is whether the safe\nharbor rule also applies in consumer unfairness cases. Cel-Tech,\nsupra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 187, fn. 12 [\"This case involves an action by a\ncompetitor alleging anticompetitive practices. Our discussion and this [safe\nharbor] test are limited to that context. Nothing we say relates to actions by\nconsumers or by competitors alleging other kinds of violations of the unfair\ncompetition law such as 'fraudulent' or 'unlawful' business practices or\n'unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.' \"]; see Capito,\nsupra, 17 Cal.5th at p. 284 [\"The UCL does not define 'unfair,' and the\n'standard for determining what business acts or practices are \"unfair\" in\nconsumer actions under the UCL is currently unsettled' \"]; accord, Nationwide\nBiweekly Administrators, Inc. v. Superior Court of Alameda County (2020) 9\nCal.5th 279, 303; Zhang v. Superior Court (2013) 57 Cal.4th 364, 380,\nfn. 9.\nThe courts have divided on this issue. A\nnumber of consumer cases apply the pre-Cel-Tech definition of\nunfairness that looks to whether the defendant's business practice \"is immoral,\nunethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers,\nand requires the court to weigh the utility of the defendant's conduct against\nthe gravity of the harm to the alleged victim.\" Drum v. San Fernando Valley\nBar Assn. (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 247, 257 (Drum); see Ticconi\nv. Blue Shield of California Life & Health Ins. Co. (2008) 160\nCal.App.4th 528, 539. 82; Bardin v. DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2006) 136\nCal.App.4th 1255, 1268-1270; Progressive West Ins. Co. v. Superior Court\n(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 263, 286; Walker v.

Aegis Security Ins. Co. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 886, 894. But other\nconsumer cases apply the Cel-Tech \"safe harbor\" rule. See Graham\nv. Bank of America, N.A. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 594, 613; Aleksick v. 7-Eleven, Inc. (2012) 205\nCal.App.4th 1176, 1192; Lopez v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2011) 201\nCal.App.4th 572, 591-594; Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183\nCal.App.4th 1350, 1364-1366; In re Firearm Cases (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th\n959, 979-983; Schnall, supra, 78 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1157-1170. And\nyet a third group of cases have adopted a definition of unfairness taken from\nFTC jurisprudence that looks to whether: \"(1) the consumer injury [is]\nsubstantial; (2) the injury [is] not ... outweighed by any countervailing\nbenefits to consumers or competition; and (3) it [is] an injury that consumers\nthemselves could not reasonably have avoided.\" Davis v. Ford Motor Credit\nCo. LLC (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 581, 597-598, citing Camacho v.\nAutomobile Club of Southern California (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1394, 1403.\nAgainst this backdrop, the California Supreme Court in Capito\ntook up the \"question ... whether hospitals have a duty, beyond what is required\nby the relevant statutory and regulatory scheme, to notify emergency room\npatients that they will be charged [evaluation and management services (EMS)]\nfees.\" Capito, supra, 17 Cal.5th at p. 277.\nThe plaintiff filed a class action suit against a hospital challenging EMS fees for two emergency room visits.\nShe did not claim that the defendant had violated its existing disclosure\nobligations or that the EMS fees were excessive or improper. She claimed only\nthat the defendant had a duty to provide additional disclosures of the fees\nbefore the emergency room services were provided, and that the defendant's\nfailure to do so was an unfair business practice in violation of section 17200.\nId. at p. 277. \nThe court rejected plaintiff's claim, finding that \"[h]ospitals do not have a duty under [section 17200 or the\nstate's Consumer Legal Remedies Act], beyond their obligations under the\nrelevant statutory and regulatory scheme, to disclose EMS fees prior to\ntreating emergency room patients. Requiring such disclosure would alter the\ncareful balance of competing interests, including price transparency and provision\nof emergency care without regard to cost, reflected in the multifaceted scheme\ndeveloped by state and federal authorities.\" Id. at p. 278.\nTo reach this conclusion, the court had to navigate the still\nunsettled waters of \"unfairness\" in consumer cases. Id. pp. 284-288. But\nthe court decided it had \"no need to decide either the Unfair Competition Law\n(UCL) standard for 'unfair' business conduct\" or \"whether the statutes\ngoverning hospital price disclosure create a safe harbor within the meaning of Cel-Tech\"\nbecause the plaintiff alleged only that defendant's \"\u00a0'practices\noffend established public policies, and are immoral, unethical, oppressive, and\nunscrupulous.' \" Id. at pp. 284, 288. The court then went on to hold\nthat because plaintiff did not satisfy any of these stated criteria within the\ncontext of the regulatory scheme at issue, she \"has not demonstrated unfairness\nunder the UCL.\" Id. at p. 288.\nAs noted, the court in Capito purported not to define\nsection 17200 \"unfairness\" in the consumer context. Id. at p. 284. However,\nCapito's alleged unfairness standard - whether the defendant's \" 'practices offend established public policies, and are\nimmoral, unethical, oppressive, and unscrupulous,' \" Ibid, - is\nmuch like the broadest pre-Cel-Tech definition of unfairness. See, e.g., Drum, supra, 182 Cal.App.4th at 257. Since the ultimate definition of unfairness in consumer cases is\nunlikely to be more expansive than the pre-Cel-Tech formula, it is\nreasonable to conclude that under Capito, an applicable statutory or\nregulatory scheme will be relevant in consumer cases to determine whether a\nparticular business practice is unfair. Capito, supra, 17 Cal.5th\nat p. 284 [\"whether or not the statutory scheme here creates a safe\nharbor [under Cel-Tech], we find the scheme relevant to discerning\nwhether [defendant's] conduct 'offends an established public policy' or is\n'immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to\nconsumers' . . . that is, whether Regional's conduct is 'unfair' under the UCL,\napplying the standard stated by Capito\"].\nIn short, Capito can be seen as a step by the California\nSupreme Court toward reining in the definition of unfairness in consumer cases\nby establishing the relevance of applicable statutes and regulations to the\nunfairness analysis.\n\n",

    "title": "California Rent Control Laws (2025) | The Complete Guide",
    "content": "Renting is extremely popular in California. Therefore, to try to keep the industry affordable, various regulations have been implemented.In 2019, California passed numerous laws (AB 1482) that were established to ensure there is affordable rental housing in the state. The purpose of this legislation is to try to solve the state's housing crisis and stabilize the population.Let's take a look at the various California rent control laws that property owners need to be aware of:Rent Control LawsRent control refers to legislation that caps rental rates and annual rent increases in cities and states. Municipalities can have different rent control regulations; however, they generally limit annual rent increases and protect tenants from eviction without reason.Furthermore, rent control is more common in urban areas since residents' access to market-rate housing is restricted by competition for available rental units.While many states officially prohibit rent control, several U.S. cities, such as Washington, D.C. and New York City, have rent control laws.In 2019, California and Oregon passed the first statewide rent control laws.It's crucial to keep in mind that there are no limits on the initial rent a landlord can charge for a vacant rental unit.California Rent Increase LawsThe state of California does have rent control that prevents excessive rent hikes. Furthermore, several California communities have their own rent control regulations.In addition to the state's legislation, the majority of California's major cities have adopted rent control measures that provide tenants with additional rights.The state's rent control laws can contradict the city's rent stabilization ordinance.If a city's local rent control laws are contradictory to the state law, the city law will take precedence if it was passed before September 1, 2019, and/or if it provides more protection for tenants.California Rent ControlA statewide law called AB 1482 governs rent hikes and gets rid of a landlord's ability to evict renters without good reason.Rent IncreasesUnder AB 1482, the maximum annual rent increase is limited to 10% and consists of a local cost-of-living adjustment of no more than 5%.The starting rent is determined from March 2019 under the law, which is retroactive.There is no upper rent cap or limit on how much a landlord can raise the rent from one occupant to the next. We'll discuss this in further detail below.Eviction ProtectionsWhen it comes to tenants who have lived in a rental property for more than one year, landlords can only evict lessees if they have a legal reason to do so:At FaultThis includes failure to pay rent, breaching the lease contract, or engaging in criminal activity on the property.When it comes to lease violations, the landlord must give the tenant the opportunity to rectify the issue.No-FaultThis includes converting the apartment into a condo, the owner moving into the rental unit, or demolishing or renovating the property.In these instances, the landlord needs to offer the tenant a \"relocation fee\" equal to one month's rent.Keep in mind that the rent control law does not enforce these rules.When Not To Increase RentIn California, landlords are prohibited from increasing rent in the middle of a fixed-term lease for certain types of discrimination (such as age or race) or certain types of retaliation (such as in response to the renter complaining about bugs).The following grounds of discrimination are prohibited by the Federal Fair Housing Act:RaceAgeReligionGenderDisabilitySexual orientationFamilial statusNationality or originThe Unruh Civil Rights Act of California also prevents discrimination because of:Source of incomeMedical conditionImmigration statusPrimary languageVeteran or military statusPhysical appearanceAccording to California law, landlords cannot raise the rent in reprisal. If an action takes place within 180 days of a tenant's action, it is seen as retaliatory.If a tenant complains about one of the following factors, and the landlord raises the rent, it is seen as retaliation:Organizing or joining a tenant's union or group.Filing a complaint regarding the property's safety or health with the respective agency.Exercising their rights under the law.Complaining about the rental property's habitability.Rent Increase AmountAccording to AB-1482, the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, landlords in California are only permitted to increase rent by 5% plus 10% or the annual inflation rate, whichever is lower.The rate of inflation is also referred to as the Consumer Price Index (CPI).Several areas are implementing the 10% rent increase limit as it is significantly less than keeping up with the Consumer Price Index given the substantial inflation experienced in the last year.However, keep in mind that this only applies to properties where rent control is in effect and that there are exceptions to the norm.State law calculates the rent increase using the regional CPI if you own property in the following counties:Orange and Los Angeles CountySan DiegoSan Bernardino and RiversideSan Francisco, Alameda, Mari, Contra Costa, and San MateoThe maximum rent increase is determined using the California CPI, as reported by the Department of Industrial Relations if you do not reside in one of these counties.Landlords in California are free to increase the rent by any amount while signing a new lease agreement if no existing occupants are present because the state's rent control regulations only apply to rent increases for existing tenants.Moreover, local governments are now prohibited by state law from imposing \"vacancy control,\" which sets a ceiling on the maximum rent increases permitted for new lessees.Rent Increase FrequencyLandlords in California are only permitted by state law to raise rent twice every 12 months if they give adequate notice and do not do so throughout the lease term.If the rent is raised twice in a calendar year, the total increase cannot go over the yearly cap.In certain cities with local rent control laws, such as East Palo Alto and Oakland, there are different increments for raising rent.These cities only allow one rate increase yearly unless the rental unit is exempt from rent control.Proper NoticeNormally, rent increases require a 30-day notice from the landlord. The landlord is required to provide 90 days' notice if they plan to increase the rent by more than 10%.\u00a0\u00a0In California, landlords are prohibited from raising rent throughout a lease term unless the lease agreement expressly permits it.ExemptionsKeep in mind that certain properties are exempt from California rent control law. These types of properties include:Condos and single family-homes not owned by a real estate investment trust (REIT), corporation, or corporation-owned LLCMobile homesCommercial propertiesHotelsDuplexes whether the landlord lives in one of the rental unitsCollege dorms and schoolsRental property managed by a non-profit organizationBuildings constructed in the past 15 yearsRental properties that are subject to pre-existing rent control ordinanceIf there are no other local laws that the landlord must abide by, they are free to increase the rent as much as they want on properties that are exempt from rent control.However, they must inform their tenants of the exemption under AB 1482 by giving them notice.Local Rent Control LawsVarious cities and counties impose additional rent controls in addition to the state limits. These cities are:Beverly Hills: There's an annual limit of 8% on rent hikes.Los Angeles: Rent increases are limited to 8% per annum. However, the limit is 10% if a new roommate moves in.Berkeley: Local laws place a limit on rent prices, parking fees, garbage fees, eviction protocols, and security deposit laws.Hayward: Annual rent increases are limited to 5%.East Palo Alto: Rent hikes are limited to 10%, including parking and utility fees as well as any other services.Palm Springs: Rent increases are limited to 75% of the CPI.Oakland: Rent increases are limited to 10%.Los Gatos: Rent can increase by over 5% of the existing monthly rent.West Hollywood: The West Hollywood rent stabilization division determines the maximum allowable rent increase.San Jose: There's a 5% cap on annual rent increases.San Francisco: The annual rent increase rate is determined by the San Francisco Rent Board.Santa Monica: Rent hikes are limited to 75% of the CPI of Los Angeles for the past year.Bottom LineThere are numerous laws in California that limit the amount of rent that landlords are permitted to charge.If you own an investment property in California, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the state and local regulations on rent hikes to avoid any legal issues.You should also keep up to date with the latest California Landlord-Tenant laws, eviction laws, and security deposit laws to ensure you are complying.

AB 1482, also known as the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, has brought significant changes to California's rental market. This law provides rent control and eviction protections for many tenants across the state. However, it's crucial to understand that not all rental properties are subject to AB 1482. In this video, we'll dive deep into the exemptions to this law, helping both landlords and tenants navigate the complex world of rental regulations. First, we'll explore the exemption for housing that has been issued a certificate of occupancy within the past 15 years. This means that newer properties are not subject to the rent control provisions outlined in AB 1482. Understanding this exemption is critical for landlords who own newer rental properties and tenants who are considering renting in recently constructed buildings. | Martinez Law Center",

    "content": "\n\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco\nSummary of Economic Activity\nEconomic activity in the Twelfth District expanded slightly during the mid-November through December reporting period. Employment levels were largely unchanged, and employee retention improved further. Wages were up slightly overall, and year-end pay increases were in line with historical averages. Price levels were generally stable in recent weeks. Retail sales grew modestly as contacts reported a solid holiday shopping season. Consumer and business services sectors saw steady to slightly higher activity over the reporting period. Manufacturing activity varied by product category, while conditions in the agriculture and resource-related sectors softened slightly. Residential real estate markets were stable overall, and commercial real estate conditions were mixed. Lending activity was steady. Demand for services related to affordable housing, food assistance, and mental health remained high from communities across the District. Contacts' economic outlook worsened slightly relative to the prior reporting period.\nLabor Markets\nEmployment levels were stable on net over the past few weeks. Employers generally noted improved retention rates, expanded applicant pools, and higher quality candidates. Open positions were easier to fill overall. However, a larger share of contacts expressed caution in their hiring decisions and hesitation to adjust their headcounts going forward relative to prior reporting periods, citing uncertainty regarding the business environment. A few reports highlighted a mismatch between job requirements and applicants' skill sets for some entry-level positions in information technology and the skilled trades. Additionally, employers noted lingering challenges hiring engineers, accountants, as well as mid-level managers in business services, finance, and health care.\nWages were up slightly up on balance. End-of-year pay adjustments and merit-based bonuses were generally in line with historical averages across sectors and geographies. Wage pressures eased in construction, manufacturing, real estate, and business services but remained somewhat elevated for engineers as well as for some senior positions in finance and information technology. Some contacts mentioned that the recent collective bargaining agreements between hotels and labor unions as well as changes to some minimum wage requirements made the leisure and hospitality sector more attractive to hourly wage workers in other sectors.\nPrices\nPrice levels were generally stable in recent weeks. On balance, nonlabor costs were unchanged in several industries, such as manufacturing, consumer and business services, and financial services. Business owners continued to report large increases in insurance premiums and health- care costs, but some noted that recent declines in energy prices, particularly for fuel, helped ease some of the cost pressures. Looking ahead, contacts generally expected their ability to pass on higher costs to customers to remain limited, and most said their prices will likely increase at a slower pace in 2025 relative to 2024, or even remain flat or decline.\nDemand remained elevated for community support services such as affordable housing, food assistance, and mental health services. Funding for nonprofit organizations from both individual donors and government sources fell. Contacts across the District reported that public and private educational institutions of all levels faced tighter financial conditions due to lower funding inflows and higher labor costs. Generally easing inflation trends lessened strain on small businesses, though challenges persisted with insurance premiums, rents, and financing costs. Small businesses and nonprofit organizations reported that recent integration of software technologies allowed them to expand their outreach efforts and provide more personalized services.\nRetail Trade and Services\nRetail sales expanded modestly over the reporting period. Contacts observed a solid holiday shopping season, similar to last year's spending. Retailers noted higher demand for outdoor products and increased foot traffic in shopping centers across the District. Sales at organic specialty stores reportedly outpaced those at regular grocery stores, particularly in the Mountain West states. Consumers continued to take advantage of promotional pricing, which bolstered overall retail sales. However, demand for some products reportedly softened, including pet specialty items and wood products at home improvement stores. Retailers generally reported adequate inventory levels, although they were somewhat lower than levels observed last year.\nActivity in consumer and business services was stable to slightly up in recent weeks. Activity in the leisure and hospitality sector picked up on balance, with increased travel demand from groups and businesses that slightly offset flat demand for leisure travel. Reports indicated lower guest counts at bars and restaurants in recent weeks, which were impacted by bad weather in parts of the District despite typical holiday-related activity. Demand for consulting services increased of late as firms inquired about the potential impact of economic policy adjustments on their business operations. Demand for health-care services remained strong. Conditions in the legal services sector were mixed by firm size, with smaller ones faring worse.\nManufacturing\nActivity in the manufacturing sector varied by product category. Demand strengthened for capital equipment as more customers invested in using automation for cost savings on existing and new tasks in response to elevated labor costs. Demand for manufactured lumber products was unchanged. A contact in the Pacific Northwest reported some general slowdown in manufacturing activity in the region but noted strengthening demand for defense manufacturing.\nConditions in agriculture and resource-related sectors softened slightly. Demand was stable for agricultural and animal products such as fruits, vegetables, meat, and dairy. Yields of food crops were solid but down compared to prior harvests. Drought conditions in the Mountain West negatively affected grain yields, while growers in California reported that water supply was not an issue. Exports of almonds fell. Log harvesting activity experienced seasonal slowing, which reduced market supply and put upward pressure on log prices. Additionally, log exports remained low because of muted demand from China. Materials and agricultural inputs were generally available. Some contacts reported persistent challenges with labor availability and generally high energy costs.\nReal Estate and Construction\nResidential real estate activity was largely unchanged from the last reporting period. High financing costs and excess supply of multifamily housing properties continued to hold back new residential construction projects. Finding skilled labor remained a challenge. High mortgage rates and home insurance costs curtailed demand in single-family markets in some regions in California and Oregon. Contacts in the Mountain West noted that strong demand for housing in areas with a growing population put upward pressure on home prices.\nConditions in the commercial real estate market were mixed. Demand for office space remained sluggish overall, though one contact reported an uptick in demand and rental rates for the most desirable office spaces. Developers put some retail and industrial projects on hold due to a recent slowdown in demand. Demand in other sectors, including infrastructure projects and government offices, was reportedly strong. Availability of raw materials generally improved of late but remained an issue for some products such as electrical and HVAC components. Construction costs, including those for insurance, electrical equipment, and steel, increased overall.\nFinancial Institutions\nLending activity was steady. Demand for business loans improved somewhat over the reporting period. Demand for consumer loans, including mortgages, was subdued due to elevated interest rates. Credit quality remained healthy overall. However, reports highlighted some credit quality concerns coming from small businesses and low-income households. Demand for deposits was unchanged, and deposit flows were stable.\n\n",

    "title": "Banks\u2019 Real Estate Exposure and Resilience - San Francisco Fed",
    "content": "Almost all depository institutions lend in the residential or commercial real estate markets and thus are exposed to declines in real estate prices. This exposure, combined with current house prices surpassing their pre-crisis peak and commercial real estate prices reaching record high levels, raises some questions about how much risk banks currently face from these markets.\nThis Economic Letter examines the capital adequacy of banks to weather a large decline in real estate prices. Since the Federal Reserve evaluates this risk for the largest banking institutions, I use a loss rate similar to that used in the Fed\u2019s stress tests to evaluate smaller bank real estate portfolios. My estimates suggest that only a small fraction of banks would be undercapitalized as a result of the hypothetical real estate loan losses in their loan portfolios.\nConcentration of real estate in bank portfolios\nWith the current high prices, a number of real estate valuation indicators have signaled growing risk or \u201cfrothiness\u201d in certain market segments. For example, the capitalization rates\u2014the ratios of operating income relative to the sale price of commercial properties\u2014have reached historical lows for multifamily residential and industrial commercial real estate. In the residential real estate market, the price-to-rent ratios in Los Angeles, Miami, and Denver are 10 to 20% above their long-run trends, compared with 4% at the national level (Brainard 2018). Regardless of potential real estate risk, the most recent bank supervisory stress tests found that the 35 largest banking organizations\u2014representing about 80% of the banking industry\u2014are strongly capitalized and would be able to lend to households and businesses under the most severe hypothetical scenario (Federal Reserve Board 2018a).\nThe thousands of smaller banks not included in the supervisory stress tests are mostly community banks that serve businesses and residents in local banking markets. They tend to have a higher portfolio concentration in real estate lending, and their loan portfolios are also less geographically diversified (FDIC 2012). Since these banks are more likely to serve local borrowers who have limited alternative financing options, the banks\u2019 own vulnerability could create a negative feedback loop that substantially tightens credit availability in some communities (Berger and Udell 2002).\nHistory shows that the failure of a large number of smaller depository institutions over a short period of time, like the Savings and Loan crisis in the 1980s, can be disruptive to the overall financial sector and economy. Furthermore, the large number of bank failures in the late 1980s and early 1990s was in part triggered by the collapse in commercial real estate prices (Wheelock 2007), and the 2008-09 global financial crisis followed the bursting of the housing bubble.\nFigure 1 shows that bank portfolio concentration in real estate in 2017 looked broadly similar to its status at the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007. The figure measures how much bank lending was concentrated in real estate across more than 5,000 U.S. banks; the 50th percentile means that half of the banks have higher concentrations and half have lower concentrations. The first two bars show that the ratio of real estate lending to total assets rose from 33% to 37% for the 25th percentile, from 46% to 51% for the 50th percentile, and from 59% to 62% for the 75th percentile.\n\nFigure 1Ratios of real estate loans to assets in 2007 and 2017\n \n\nBreaking total real estate lending into residential and commercial components provides similar pictures, with commercial concentrations falling slightly while residential concentrations rose slightly.\u00a0\nWhile real estate loan concentration today looks similar to its status at the onset of the global financial crisis, banks have tightened their loan underwriting standards a great deal since then, as shown by the Federal Reserve Senior Loan Officers Opinion Surveys conducted after the crisis (Federal Reserve Board 2018b). Nevertheless, if real estate prices drop abruptly, do banks have sufficient capital to withstand it?\nCapitalization\nThe banking industry is much better capitalized today than in 2007. The biggest improvement in capitalization is among the largest banks, whose capital has more than doubled over the past 10 years. While the buildup of bank capital since the financial crisis is most evident among large banking organizations, all banking organizations are subject to new and improved capital standards that emphasize not only the quantity but also the quality of bank capital. This improvement followed the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 and U.S. banking regulators\u2019 adoption of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision\u2019s new capital standards (Basel III).\nRegarding quantity, the new capital standard increased the level of capital requirements to ensure that banks are sufficiently resilient to withstand losses in times of stress. It raised the minimum common equity from 2% to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets. In addition, banks are required to hold a capital conservation buffer comprising common equity of 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. If a bank\u2019s common equity falls into the buffer range, its discretionary capital distributions will be constrained to preserve capital.\nRegarding quality, the new capital standard places a greater focus on going-concern, loss-absorbing capital in the form of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. It raised the composition of high quality CET1 capital in meeting the total capital requirements under the new standard.\nEstimated effects of real estate loan losses on bank capital\nIn general, a decline in real estate prices raises real estate loan delinquency, which is eventually written down as loan losses. Despite that typical transmission mechanism, different banks are exposed to different types of real estate lending in different parts of the country. A borrower\u2019s decision to default depends not only on the value of the underlying collateral but also other factors including cash flow, option values, and stigma.\nSince the terms of bank lending and the specifics of loan workouts generally are not provided in publicly available banking data, estimating the effects of falling real estate prices on individual bank performance is quite challenging. As an alternative, I examine banks\u2019 loss absorbing capacity, that is, CET1 plus Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses to withstand real estate credit losses. Specifically, I address the question, will hypothetical stress-induced losses in a bank\u2019s real estate portfolio make the bank undercapitalized?\nFor this exercise, I collected bank-level financial statement data from the Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) gathered by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council for those banks that were not covered by the Federal Reserve stress tests. I use the real estate portfolio loss rates under the severely adverse scenario in the 2018 Federal Reserve Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test, which assumed house prices fall 30%, and commercial real estate prices fall 40% by the third quarter of 2019. Under this scenario, the supervisory estimates projected loss rates for first-lien mortgages was 2.7%, junior liens and home equity lines of credit 4.9%, and commercial real estate loans 8.3% (Federal Reserve Board 2018a).\nTo determine whether the hypothetical stress losses could make a bank undercapitalized, I followed the standard supervisory thresholds for bank capital adequacy. A bank is considered well capitalized by its banking supervisor when the Tier-1 Risk-Based capital ratio is at least 8%, adequately capitalized when the ratio is at least 6% but less than 8%, undercapitalized when the ratio is at least 4% but less than 6%, and significantly undercapitalized when the ratio is less than 4%. While adequately capitalized banks are subject to heightened supervisory scrutiny, undercapitalized institutions must file an acceptable capital restoration plan with its regulator; they also cannot pay dividends or management fees, may not accept brokered deposits, and may not solicit any deposits by offering substantially higher rates. Significantly undercapitalized institutions face the same constraints plus limitations on executive compensation and other restrictions deemed necessary by regulators.\nA few caveats are in order. I do not intend this exercise to be comparable to a comprehensive stress test where the entire bank balance sheet is stressed under a broad severe economic scenario. Rather, it is a narrowly targeted exercise about the effects of a hypothetical real estate price decline on bank capital. Hence, unlike the Fed\u2019s stress test where the decline in real estate prices and a severe recession are assumed to take place concurrently, this exercise is solely about a real estate price decline without a severe recession. Thus, using the real estate scenario in the Fed\u2019s stress test may exaggerate the real estate portfolio losses. By applying the aggregate loss rates to all banks immediately, this exercise does not take into consideration idiosyncratic differences in each bank\u2019s underwriting standards, of which data is limited; assuming an immediate hit to bank capital instead of spreading the losses over two years also denies banks the possibility of making up some of the losses through earnings.\nI apply the hypothetical loan loss rates to the real estate portfolio of all banks not covered by the Federal Reserve stress tests. Figure 2 shows the portion of the banking industry by number of banks and by percent of banking assets that would be undercapitalized: 72 banks (1.3%) would be undercapitalized and 15 banks (0.2%) would be significantly undercapitalized. Total assets of these 87 banks account for less than 1% of the banking industry.\n\nFigure 2Small estimated share of banks are undercapitalized\n \n\nFor robustness, I also stress each bank\u2019s entire loan portfolio using the aggregate supervisory estimate of portfolio loss rates in the 2018 stress test: 8.3% for commercial real estate loans, 2.7% for first-lien mortgages, 4.9% for junior-lien mortgages, 7.3% for commercial and industrial loans, and 14.4% for credit card loans. Assuming an immediate hit to bank capital with the hypothetical stress losses to the entire portfolio, 193 banks would be undercapitalized and 21 banks significantly undercapitalized. Total assets of these 214 banks account for about 5% of the entire banking industry. To put these results into perspective, between 1988 and 1991, a total of 1,656 FDIC-insured depository institutions either failed or received assistance; together their total assets accounted for about 20% of the banking industry at that time.\nConclusions\nBank real estate loan concentration today looks broadly similar to that at the onset of the global financial crisis. However, the banking system today should be more resilient due to the notable increase in both the quantity and the quality of bank capital, especially among the largest banking organizations. Moreover, loan underwriting standards have improved since the financial crisis. Assuming an immediate real estate portfolio loss similar to the severity in the Fed\u2019s stress tests of large banks, the simulation described in this Letter shows that only a handful of small banks representing a small fraction of the industry would be significantly undercapitalized.\nSimon Kwan is a senior research advisor in the Economic Research Department of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.\nReferences\nBerger, Allen N., and Gregory F.

    "title": "Housing Market Interventions and Residential Mobility in the San Francisco Bay Area - San Francisco Fed",
    "content": "The San Francisco Bay Area is an extreme case of a constrained housing market, with job growth outpacing new housing production and resulting in supply shortages and price spikes that date back at least 30 years. The Bay Area\u2019s structural shortage of housing that is affordable at all income levels affects the regional economy by increasing commuting and housing costs, which creates barriers to full economic participation, especially for lower income workers. An array of solutions have been considered, including subsidized housing production, affordable housing preservation, and tenant protection programs. However, there is little evaluation research available to inform which housing solutions will be most effective in stabilizing communities so that those who wish to stay are able to, even in the midst of an influx of newcomers.\nThis study seeks to fill this gap by examining the impacts of market-rate development, subsidized development, and tenant protections, including rent stabilization and just cause for evictions protections, on movers. Specifically, this study builds two unique and cross-validated datasets on mobility and links them to a bespoke block-level housing construction database. We use granular data on individual and household mobility to assess how specific housing interventions impact both direct and indirect displacement by looking at moves both out of and into neighborhoods with different characteristics in the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area.\nOur research reveals that new market-rate construction in a neighborhood results in a slight increase in people of all income levels moving in and moving out, i.e., churn. The increase in rates of displacement (involuntary moves) for very low- to moderate-socio-economic groups is not as high as commonly feared, at 0.5% to 2% above normal rates. However, the highest socio-economic group disproportionately benefits from new market-rate housing production\u2014they are the least likely to move out and the most likely to move into neighborhoods with new construction. We also find that rent stabilization and just cause eviction protections help residents of the lowest socio-economic status remain in their neighborhoods. At the same time, these protections may have exclusionary impacts as we find that fewer low-income people move into neighborhoods with tenant protections. Together, these findings suggest that equitable solutions to the housing crisis will require more than just upzoning and tenant protections\u2014these are complementary solutions, but not enough. Preserving unsubsidized affordable housing and substantially expanding social housing would help mitigate displacement and exclusion while addressing the housing affordability crisis through market rate housing production and tenant protections. Social housing is the provision of rental or homeownership units affordable at a moderate income or below, and is run by a public or nonprofit entity. To work, it would need to be widely implemented, requiring government investment at levels that match the urgency of the housing crisis.\nWhat follows is a short summary of the main findings of the study. Practitioner-oriented findings on the implications of new production, subsidized development, and tenant protections will be presented in a series of forthcoming policy briefs by the authors.\nA Note on Methods\nWe use individual and household mobility and the type of neighborhood moved to (similar or downward) as proxies for displacement, or forced moves, and assess exclusionary displacement by examining who moves into neighborhoods following specific interventions. To measure displacement, we track the movements of individual households by income and financial stability levels in and out of neighborhoods, using two different proprietary datasets on individual and household characteristics: Infogroup and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax data. We categorize residents into five socio-economic status (SES) groups: extremely low, very low-low, moderate-middle, middle-high, and high.\nImpacts of Market-Rate Production\nAbout 20% of Bay Area renters live in a block group with new housing. We find that when new market-rate housing is built, there is a slight increase in both people moving out of the neighborhood and people moving in (churn) across most socio-economic groups.\nOpposite Effects on Lower SES Outmigration and High-SES Moving Out Rates\nIn particular, we find that new market-rate housing production slightly increases outmigration from the neighborhood for people of lower SES, and slightly decreases moving out for high-SES people.\nFor SES groups ranging from very low through moderate, 100 new market-rate housing units are associated with marginal increases in outmigration, ranging from 0.5 to 2% above normal rates in the first year after construction, generally declining from the second to fourth year. In other words, in a typical year, about 13 of every 100 moderate-SES households moves out, but with 100 new market-rate units in the neighborhood, about 15 move out.\nThe highest socio-economic status residents are slightly less likely to move out when new housing is built. Where 15 high socio-economic status households would have moved out without the new construction, 14 move out when 100 new units are built (a decrease in moving out rate of less than 1%).\nResidents of extremely low and middle socio-economic status experience little change in moving out of their neighborhood.\nOur model suggests that if 1,000 new units are built instead of 100, the impacts on inmigration and outmigration for all income groups would increase only very slightly; very low- to moderate-income groups would still experience increases in outmigration and inmigration of 1-2% in each subsequent year for four years when new market-rate construction occurs in their block group.\nIncrease in Inmigration\nWe find that that new market-rate housing production increases migration into neighborhoods throughout the Bay Area, for all socio-economic groups, though higher socioeconomic groups are more likely to move in compared to others.\nFor extremely low-SES households, inmigration is approximately one percentage point higher with the new construction of 100 market-rate units, so that 13 households would move in for every 12 that would move in without the construction.\nVarying Effects on Gentrifying Neighborhoods\nIn the Bay Area\u2019s gentrifying neighborhoods (neighborhoods with fast-rising incomes and an influx of high-income or highly-educated residents), new market-rate housing construction\u202fneither worsens nor eases rates of moving out, according to our study. It increases rates of people moving in across all socio-economic groups, particularly high-socio-economic residents.\nRates of people moving out remain the same in gentrifying areas for four years after construction of 100 units, with the exception of the highest socio-economic status residents; they are much more likely to move out (increasing from 22% to 31%). Middle socio-economic status residents are slightly less likely to move out.\nRates of people moving into a gentrifying area after new construction increases at first for all socio-economic groups, but by four years later goes back to normal for all groups except high-socio-economic status folks, who continue to move in at higher rates.\nThe slight impacts occur despite controlling for previous churn patterns, i.e., controlling for outmigration and inmigration rates in previous years.\nSlight Increase in Constrained Moves\nWe find that market-rate housing construction is associated with a slightly higher chance of making a downward move\u2014a move to a lower-opportunity neighborhood\u2014for all socio-economic groups.\nFor every 100 new market-rate units built, residents who move out are slightly more likely (0.2 to 0.62 percentage points across SES groups) to move to neighborhoods with a lower median income or higher poverty rate (i.e., a \u201cconstrained move\u201d).\nImpact of Subsidized Development\nThere is too little subsidized housing construction to identify substantial impacts on displacement.\u202fSubsidized housing is effective at encouraging low-socio-economic status residents to move into neighborhoods, but effects do not last long after units are built.\nOur findings on the insignificant impacts of subsidized housing construction on displacement are likely due to the lack of affordable units available for analysis. In addition, new subsidized housing units may be reserved for residents from outside the neighborhood, thus failing to mitigate local displacement effects.\nImpacts of Tenant Protections\nRent Stabilization\nOur analysis suggests that rent stabilization helps some\u2014the lowest socio-economic status residents\u2014to stay in a neighborhood. At the same time, it may be exclusionary as it discourages moving in for all socio-economic groups except moderate-middle socio-economic status.\n\nRent stabilization decreases the probability of moving out for the lowest socio-economic status residents in our sample by about 1 percentage point.\nHowever, in gentrifying areas, rent stabilization has no significant effects on keeping very low socio-economic status residents in place.\nWith an increase in units covered by rent stabilization in a neighborhood, all residents except those of moderate-middle socio-economic status experience declines in moving in.\n\nThese exclusionary impacts of rent stabilization are likely due to the lower numbers of available units, as tenant protections effectively reduce move-out rates by allowing renters to stay.\nJust Cause Protections\nJust cause protections help to keep the lowest socioeconomic status residents in place in gentrifying neighborhoods, where displacement pressures may be especially strong, according to our findings. However, these policies of course are limited to protecting existing residents and do not encourage residents to move in.\nAs more units are covered by tenant protections, we find that lower socio-economic status residents are not much more or less likely to move into neighborhoods, and high socio-economic status residents are less likely to move in.\nWe find that renters make fewer downward moves from tracts where more units are covered by just cause protections\u2014suggesting people are able to make planned moves.\nWhen there are more units covered by tenant protections (just cause for evictions and/or rent stabilization) in a census tract, renters in all income groups who move away from that tract are more likely to stay within the same city, less likely to move elsewhere in the Bay Area, and more likely to move outside of California. In other words, tenant protections shift migration patterns in two opposing ways, facilitating moves either nearby to their original homes or out of the state entirely.\nOverall Impact of Interventions on Residential Mobility\nOverall, new market-rate housing units are associated with a slight increase in both outmigration and inmigration from neighborhoods, i.e., more churn, for different income groups. Over the short-term, the net impact is minimal, suggesting a level of impact that is mitigable through policies to promote housing affordability. Tenant protections will also help to mitigate displacement but may increase exclusion (by decreasing inmigration to neighborhoods) for some low-socio-economic groups without being coupled with other tools.\nAcquiring multi-unit rental properties that are at risk of becoming unaffordable via a program like San Francisco\u2019s Small Sites Acquisition and Rehab Program may be an effective strategy. Other potential approaches include tenant or community opportunity to purchase policies such as San Francisco\u2019s, transfer tax breaks for building owners when selling to a nonprofit or community land trust condominium conversion restrictions, and community land trusts. Considerations to address the housing affordability crisis and mitigate displacement and exclusion include the preservation of unsubsidized affordable housing, as well as initiatives that substantially expand social housing.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco or the Federal Reserve System.\n\nChapple, Karen, Jackelyn Hwang, Jae Sik Jeon, Iris Zhang, Julia Greenberg, and Bina P.

    "title": "California's AB 1482 Law",
    "content": "Also known as the Tenant Protection Act of 2019Effective August 2025, the rent cap in Glendale will be 8%. California's AB 1482 law, also known as the Tenant Protection Act, has brought significant changes to the rental market, offering increased protections for tenants while outlining specific rights and responsibilities for landlords.The passage of AB 1482 marks a significant development in California's ongoing efforts to address the state's housing crisis. Housing affordability has become a pressing concern for many residents, as soaring rents have led to widespread financial hardships and increased the risk of displacement.We will focus on the rent cap section of AB 1482, which is particularly relevant to Glendale, California. Whether you are a landlord or a tenant, understanding the provisions of this law is crucial for navigating the rental landscape in compliance with the regulations.AB 1482 and Rent CapsAB 1482 introduces rent caps to prevent excessive rent increases and ensure affordable housing options for tenants. Rent Cap Limitations: Under AB 1482, landlords in California, are subject to a rent cap that limits the amount they can increase rents annually. The law establishes the rent cap as 5% plus the percentage change in the cost of living, or a maximum of 10% in total, whichever is lower. Landlords cannot raise the rent beyond the specified limits within a 12-month period.\u201cPercentage change in the cost of living\u201d means the percentage change in the regional Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the region where the residential real property is located. The law uses CPI from April 1 of the prior year to April 1 of the current year. The CPU is published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics on a monthly bases. While the calculation of the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is based on a year-to-year comparison from April to April, it is important for landlords to note that the implementation of the new rent increase takes effect in August.Applicability in Glendale: Glendale, being part of California, follows the guidelines set forth by AB 1482. The rent cap provisions apply to properties that are not otherwise exempt under the law.  The current rent limit/cap in Glendale is 8.9%.Effective August 2025, the rent cap in Glendale will be 8%. AB 1482 and Glendale's Rental Rights Program work in tandem to establish robust tenant protections. Landlords must be mindful of both sets of regulations when considering rent increases. In cases where a rent increase exceeds 7%, it triggers relocation fees as per the Rental Rights Program. However, it is essential to note that no rent increase can surpass the statewide cap, which currently stands at 8.9% effective from August 2023. Even if landlords have banked or accumulated unused rent increases, they are still bound by the 8.9% limit and cannot exceed it.Exemptions\nWhile AB 1482's rent cap provisions apply to most rental properties, certain exemptions may exist. These exemptions include:Affordable housing: Housing that is restricted by deed, regulatory agreements with government agencies, or other recorded documents as affordable housing for individuals and families with very low, low, or moderate income.Dormitories in educational institutions: Housing in dormitories constructed and maintained by higher education institutions within the state, intended for occupancy by students enrolled in those institutions.Newly constructed housing: Residential real properties that have received a certificate of occupancy within the previous 15 years.Separately alienable properties: Single-family homes, condominiums, townhomes with the condition that the owner is not a real estate investment trust, corporation, or limited liability company with corporate members. Tenants must be provided written notice stating that the property is exempt from rent limits and just cause requirements.Owner-occupied duplexes: A duplex where the owner occupies one of the units as their primary residence at the start of the tenancy, as long as the owner continues to reside there.It is important to note that these exemptions may be subject to specific conditions and requirements, and they may vary based on local regulations and ordinances.The information provided on this website is not intended to be legal advice. It is recommended to consult an attorney and conduct thorough research before taking any action related to tenancy matters.",

    "title": "Santa Barbara City Council to Study Effects of AB 1482 - The Santa Barbara Independent",
    "content": "There was plenty of drama but not much action at a special evening meeting of the Santa Barbara City Council on Tuesday to discuss new tenant rights legislation. The question being considered was whether the council could impose even stronger tenant protections than those in Assembly Bill 1482, signed into California law last fall. In the end, the council unanimously voted to commission a new study to determine how much landlords would be required to pay tenants forced to move through no fault of theirs.Under AB 1482\u2009\u200b\u2014\u2009\u200ban omnibus tenant-protection measure\u2009\u200b\u2014\u2009\u200blandlords now have to pay those tenants one month\u2019s rent to cover moving costs. But a proposed city ordinance the council was considering last April, before the new state law was approved, would require landlords to pay up to five months\u2019 rent or $5,000, whichever was more.In the packed chamber, smaller \u201cmom-and-pop\u201d landlords warned that such additional requirements would be economically catastrophic, forcing them to sell to bigger, out-of-town rental companies\u2009\u200b\u2014\u2009\u200bnot the sort of landlords to charge rents 30 percent below market\u2009\u200b\u2014\u2009\u200bas one worried property owner claimed. They wanted the council to hold off on passing any additional protections until discovering what impact the new state laws will have.Dr. Samuel De Palma, a theater arts performance professor with a basso profundo voice, predicted that his 90-year-old mother \u201cmight lose her home\u201d if she found herself forced to pay $5,000 in relocation assistance to one of her two tenants. What if his mother needed to evict a tenant to make room for an in-home care provider? \u201cMy mother has no savings, no money to pay five months\u2019 rent.\u201dSimilar concerns were expressed by other landlords. Some testified they had been homeless themselves at one time. Many described how hard they worked to maintain their properties and how the cost of doing business was exploding. One said her insurance had increased from $8,000 to $18,000. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be looked at as if I\u2019m the \u2018Evil Empire,\u2019\u201d another landlord said.Tenants\u2019 rights advocates also showed up in significant numbers. Frank Rodriguez and Lucas Zucker from CAUSE (Central Coast Alliance United for a Sustainable Economy) argued the exodus of low-income tenants chased out of town by rising rents and no-fault evictions has been increasing steadily for years. They noted that Santa Barbara rents had increased 27 percent between 2014 and 2019 around the time an out-of-town company started buying up Westside apartment houses and evicting tenants. Zucker argued that the economic hardships caused by no-cause evictions were just as hard even if caused by small landlords instead of big corporations. \u201cWe don\u2019t let small corporations dump toxic waste into the ocean,\u201d he stated.Councilmember Eric Friedman said he knew firsthand the consequences of evictions. A rent increase forced his own family to move from Santa Barbara to Lompoc when he was 12 in the middle of a school year. As a result, the Lompoc school would not admit him. Friedman\u2019s solution is for City Hall to create a new public bank to finance the construction of new housing. That, he said, would require a new bond or tax, and he put landlords on notice he expected their support.Most councilmembers said they would not support $5,000 relocation fees except in instances of mass evictions, though it was not clear what precisely they meant by \u201cmass eviction.\u201d A majority of councilmembers were intent on maximizing protections for the most economically vulnerable tenants\u2009\u200b\u2014\u2009\u200bthe elderly, the disabled, and those with low incomes. The newly commissioned study presumably will unearth data that will help councilmembers better calibrate how much relief they hoped to extract on behalf of which tenants. That study should be completed within 60 days.\u00a0 \u00a0  ",

Trump (S.D.N.Y.) \n\nCase No 1:25-cv-02886\nSecond Circuit No: 25-1671Habeas petition and Class complaint\n\nMotion for TRO2025-04-08Overview:  Plaintiffs are two Venezuelan nationals (proceeding under pseudonym) in immigration custody in New York. They have filed a habeas petition asking the court to stop the government from removing them from the United States under the purported authority of the Alien Enemies Act Presidential Proclamation, and to declare the Proclamation unlawful. The case has been brought on behalf of themselves and a class of all other persons similarly situated, to include all noncitizens from Venezuela in immigration custody in the Southern District of New York, who were, are, or will be subject to the Proclamation. The court has temporarily blocked the Defendants from removing the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated in the Southern District of New York. Defendants have appealed the court\u2019s decisions to the Second Circuit.\nCase Summary: On March 15, 2025, President Donald Trump published a Presidential Proclamation titled \u201cInvocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua\u201d (Proclamation), which sought to authorize removal of noncitizens from Venezuela who are deemed to be \u201cenemy aliens\u201d under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). \nPetitioners are two Venezuelan men who have been arrested and detained by immigration authorities, and allegedly face imminent deportation pursuant to the Proclamation. \nPetitioners argue that the removal process established under the Proclamation is unlawful. They argue that such process is ultra vires under the AEA, as the AEA only authorizes removals during a declared war or invasion of the United States by a foreign nation or government, and further requires additional process prior to removing noncitizens. They also argue that the removal process violates various provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, including those that establish procedures and mechanisms for, as well as protections against, removal (including sending someone to a country where they are more likely than not to face torture). Finally, they argue that the removal process violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the right to habeas corpus. \nPetitioners have brought their petition and complaint on behalf of a similarly situated class, including all noncitizens in immigration custody who were, are, or will be subject to the Proclamation.\nPetitioners have requested that the court certify the class, grant a writ of habeas corpus to Petitioners that enjoins Defendants from removing them pursuant to the Proclamation, and declare the Proclamation unlawful.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 11, the court certified the class and granted a temporary restraining order preventing their removal from the district or the United States.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 17, petitioners filed a reply in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction. The reply asserts that the government has not satisfied due process requirements in use of the AEA and that the proclamation violates both procedural requirements and Congressionally established protections for noncitizens seeking humanitarian protections.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 21, the government moved to vacate the class certification, alleging the class cannot be certified because the court lacks jurisdiction over the matter. \nUpdate 4: On Apr. 22, Judge Alvin Hellerstein extended the temporary restraining order issued on Apr. 11 through May 6.\nUpdate 5: On May 6, Judge Hellerstein granted a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 6: On May 6, the court denied respondent\u2019s motion to decertify the class, stating that because it is unknown how many people may become subject to an order for removal, judicial efficiency and due process considerations for individuals yet to be removed support a class action.\nUpdate 7: On May 14, the Court granted the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, stating that the Plaintiffs and the certified class are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that the Proclamation violates the Alien Enemies Act.\nUpdate 8: On July 3, the government appealed Judge Hellerstein\u2019s May 6 and May 14 orders to the Second Circuit.2025-07-03\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Alien Enemies Act removals (Presidential Proclamation 10903)J.A.V. v.

The case has been brought on behalf of themselves and a class of all other persons similarly situated, to include all noncitizens from Venezuela in immigration custody in the Southern District of Texas, who were, are, or will be subject to the Proclamation. The court has blocked the Defendants from using the Alien Enemies Act to detain or remove the Plaintiffs and others similarly situated in the Southern District of Texas. Defendants have appealed the court\u2019s decision to the Fifth Circuit.\nCase Summary: On March 15, 2025, President Donald Trump published a Presidential Proclamation titled \u201cInvocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of The United States by Tren De Aragua\u201d (Proclamation), which sought to authorize removal of noncitizens from Venezuela who are deemed to be \u201cenemy aliens\u201d under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). \nPetitioners are three Venezuelan men who have been arrested and detained by immigration authorities at El Valle Detention Center in Texas, and allegedly face imminent deportation pursuant to the Proclamation. \nPetitioners argue that the removal process established under the Proclamation is unlawful. They argue that such process is ultra vires under the AEA, as the AEA authorizes removals only during a declared war or invasion of the United States by a foreign nation or government, and further requires additional process prior to removing noncitizens.

Petitioners filed an emergency application for a temporary restraining order (TRO) due to being in imminent danger of removal to another country. \nOn April 9, 2025, Judge Fernando Rodriguez granted petitioners\u2019 TRO on an ex parte basis and blocked Respondents from transferring, relocating, or removing petitioners \"or any other person that Respondents claim are subject to removal under the Proclamation, from the El Valle Detention Center; and Respondents are enjoined from transporting such persons outside of Willacy County or Cameron County, Texas, without an Order from the Court.\" Absent further action, the TRO will be in place through Apr. 23, 2025.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 11, the TRO was extended through Apr. 25, 2025.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 16, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 23, Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, asserting that Plaintiffs failed to show they would succeed on the merits of their claims and that they failed to establish standing for injunctive relief. On that same day, Plaintiffs filed a reply in further support of their motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 24, Judge Rodriguez granted a superseding TRO against the Defendants (excluding Trump) that is effective through May 2, 2025. This new TRO expands the scope of the previous by blocking Defendants from removing, transferring, relocating, or deporting any person that Respondents designate as an alien enemy outside of the Southern District of Texas, whereas the former TRO applied only to the El Valle Detention Center.\nUpdate 5: On May 1, Judge Rodriquez granted certification of the class of plaintiffs, described as: \u201cVenezuelan aliens, 14 years old or older, who have not been naturalized, who Respondents have designated or in the future designate as alien enemies under the March 14, 2025, Presidential Proclamation \u2026 and who are detained or reside in the Southern District of Texas.\u201d\nJudge Rodriguez followed the class certification with an order granting a permanent injunction. The court wrote: \"The historical record renders clear that the President\u2019s invocation of the AEA [Alien Enemies Act] through the Proclamation exceeds the scope of the statute and is contrary to the plain, ordinary meaning of the statute\u2019s terms.\" On the scope of the injunction, Judge Rodriguez wrote: \u201cTo the extent that J.A.V., J.G.G., and W.G.H., or any member of the certified class, have been detained or are detained in the future pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act, they have not sought and do not obtain any relief. In addition, the conclusions of the Court do not affect Respondents\u2019 ability to continue removal proceedings or enforcement of any final orders of removal issued against J.A.V., J.G.G., and W.G.H, or against any member of the certified class, under the Immigration and Nationality Act.\u201d\nUpdate 6: On June 27, Defendants appealed Judge Rodriquez\u2019s May 1 orders to the Fifth Circuit.2025-06-27\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Alien Enemies Act removals (Presidential Proclamation 10903)Zacarias Matos v. Venegas (S.D. Tex.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00057\n\nCASE CLOSEDHabeas petition2025-03-15Overview: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers tried to remove Daniel Enrique Zacarias Matos, a Venezuelan national who is detained at the El Valle Detention Facility, from the United States. Zacarias Matos filed a petition to prevent his removal from the US unless and until he receives a final removal order. The Government asserts that the Alien Enemies Act authorizes his removal. The court has issued a preliminary injunction and set a hearing to assess evidence of the government\u2019s claim that he is a member of the Venezuelan TdA gang.\nSummary: Daniel Enrique Zacarias Matos brought a habeas petition to prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers from removing him from the United States unless and until he receives a final removal order. The Government states that the Alien Enemies Act, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 21, authorizes his removal based on the March 15 Presidential Proclamation.\nICE officials tried to remove Zacarias Matos, a Venezuelan national who is detained at the El Valle Detention Facility, from the United States on Mar. 14, but they were allegedly unable to do so due to a problem with the flight. \nZacarias Matos claims that the attempt to remove him violates 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a of the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution, and asked the Court to enjoin his imminent removal unless and until a removal order is entered against him.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 7, Judge Fernando Rodriguez granted a preliminary injunction and set an evidentiary hearing for May 5 on whether the petitioner is a member of TdA.\nUpdate 2: On May 13, 2025, following a joint status report and motion to dismiss request, the Court ordered the case dismissed without prejudice.2025-05-13\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Alien Enemies Act removals (Presidential Proclamation 10903)D.B.U. v. Trump (D. Colo.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01163Class petition for habeas2025-04-12Overview:  On Mar. 14, President Donald Trump signed a presidential proclamation purporting to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to allow for removal of alleged members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang. Plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit arguing the Act does not apply to these circumstances, in addition to constitutional and other statutory arguments. The court has provisionally issued a temporary block to any removals of petitioners and the class they represent. The court has also ordered the government to provide 21 days notice to any individual they intend to move under the Act. Defendants appealed these court orders to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, but have since voluntarily dismissed these appeals. The court issued a block to any removals, detentions, or transfers of the petitioners and class members, which Defendants have since appealed.\nSummary: On Mar. 14, President Donald Trump signed a Proclamation purporting to invoke the authority of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to summarily deport Venezuelan nationals alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang. Two Venezuelan nationals in U.S. immigration custody have brought a proposed class action on behalf of all noncitizens in custody in Colorado who are, were, or will be subject to the Mar. 14 Proclamation, along with a habeas petition. They allege that the preconditions of the AEA have not been met and that the Proclamation is unlawful, that they have been denied the opportunity to voluntarily leave the U.S. in violation of the AEA, that the government has violated the Immigration and Naturalization Act and the Foreign Affairs and Reform and Restructuring Act, that they have been denied due process under the Fifth Amendment, and that they have been denied their right to habeas corpus. The Petitioners submitted an emergency application for a temporary restraining order asking the court to block any removals of Petitioners and the class they represent from Colorado.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 14, Judge Charlotte Sweeney temporarily blocked removal of the Petitioners and the class they represent.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 17, Defendants filed a response to Petitioners\u2019 emergency application for a temporary restraining order (TRO). Defendants contend the Court lacks jurisdiction over the habeas proceeding because Petitioners are not subject to the Proclamation or detained pursuant to it, and Petitioners have yet to receive a notice that they will be removed under it.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 20, Petitioners filed a reply in support of their motion for an emergency TRO and requested the Court maintain the TRO due to the government\u2019s transfer of detainees under the AEA with less than 24 hours notice.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 22, Judge Sweeney granted Petitioners\u2019 emergency motion for a TRO and ordered that Plaintiffs and members of the provisionally certified class to not be transferred outside of the District of Colorado. Judge Sweeney ordered the government to provide 21 day notice to petitioners and members of the provisionally certified class before moving said individuals and that this notice must note that the government intends to remove these individuals pursuant to the AEA and Proclamation.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 23, Defendants appealed Judge Sweeney\u2019s orders granting Petitioners\u2019 TRO to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 25, Petitioners filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent Defendants being able to send Petitioners and class members to El Salvador under the AEA and Proclamation.\nUpdate 7: On May 6, Judge Sweeney granted a preliminary injunction and granted Petitioners\u2019 class certification to include all noncitizens in custody in the District of Colorado who may become or are subject to the AEA and Proclamation.\nUpdate 8: On May 12, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the appellants\u2019 motion for voluntary dismissal of their Apr. 23 appeal.\nUpdate 9: On July 7, Defendants appealed Judge Sweeney\u2019s May 6 preliminary injunction order to the Tenth Circuit.2025-07-07\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Alien Enemies Act removals (Presidential Proclamation 10903)J.G.G. v.

The White House publicly released the proclamation on the afternoon of Mar. 15. Plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit arguing the 1798 statute does not apply to these circumstances, and the judge provisionally agreed issuing a temporary block to any removals until further hearings. The Court of Appeals upheld the judge\u2019s ruling on appeal. The district court issued two Temporary Restraining Orders (TROs) against the government on Mar. 15 that have been extended through Apr. 12. The government appealed this decision to the Supreme Court, which then vacated the decision on the ground that a habeas case should have been filed instead. The district court has since found the government to be in contempt of court, however the Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay of this order. The plaintiffs have amended their origins; complaint to include habeas petitions for the men who are in El Salvador\u2019s CECOT prison. The district court has since ordered the government to facilitate the detainees\u2019 ability to exercise their habeas rights.\nSummary: On Mar. 14, President Trump signed a Proclamation purporting to invoke the authority of the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport Venezuelan nationals alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang.\nIn the early hours of Saturday, Mar. 15, five Venezuelan nationals in U.S. immigration custody brought a proposed class action lawsuit challenging the government\u2019s action on the ground that the Alien Enemies Act does not provide authority for such removals; that the removals would be in violation of immigration statutes governing deportation proceedings and the Administrative Procedure Act, in addition to a violation of habeas corpus. The Plaintiffs submitted an emergency application for a temporary restraining order asking the court to block any removals from the United States.\nIn an emergency hearing on Mar. 15, Chief Judge James Boasberg, first ruling from the bench, certified a class of \u201call noncitizens in U.S. custody who are subject to the Mar. 15, 2025 Presidential Proclamation,\u201d and granted the request for a temporary restraining order to block removals of any class members from the United States.\nUpdate 1: The same day, Mar. 15, the government submitted a notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit. The judge issued a verbal order, in a ruling from the bench, and a written TRO that evening.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 17, Defendants moved to vacate the TRO.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 18, Chief Judge James Boasberg issued a  minute order requiring Defendants to submit a declaration explaining what time the flights that left U.S. airspace prior to the filing of the TRO departed and landed, when the individuals aboard left U.S. custody, and the number of people aboard subject to the President\u2019s Proclamation. \nUpdate 4: On Mar. 19, Defendants filed a motion to stay Chief Judge Boasberg\u2019s March 18th minute order, arguing that they required more time to invoke the state secrets privilege, avoid disclosure of sensitive information, and prevent harm to foreign relations. \nUpdate 5: On Mar. 19, Chief Judge Boasberg issued an order permitting Defendants an additional day to respond to the Mar. 18 Order, but expressing skepticism about their stated intention to invoke the state-secrets doctrine.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 19, Plaintiffs filed a motion in opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to vacate the TRO. \nUpdate 7: On Mar. 20, Chief Judge Boasberg issued an order requiring Defendants to show cause for its failure to comply with the TRO, and it also granted Defendants\u2019 delay to invoke the state-secrets privilege.\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 24, Chief Judge Boasberg issued a memorandum opinion granting Plaintiffs\u2019 TRO.\nUpdate 9: On Mar. 25, Defendants filed a notice invoking the state-secrets privilege in response to the Mar. 18 minute order. \nUpdate 10: On Mar. 26, Plaintiffs filed a Notice that they intended to file a new Motion for Preliminary Injunction on Friday, Mar. 28, to incorporate \u201cadditional factual material so that there is a more complete record.\u201d\nThat same day, the D.C. Circuit. in a 2-1 decision, denied Defendants\u2019 motion to stay the TRO. \nUpdate 11: On Mar. 27, the Plaintiffs filed a motion to extend the TROs set to expire on Mar. 29 for 14 days to Apr. 12, claiming that good cause exists to extend the TROs.\nUpdate 12: On Mar. 28, the Defendants appealed to the Supreme Court asking to vacate the district court\u2019s order and to issue an administrative stay.\nUpdate 13: On Mar. 28, the Defendants filed an opposition to the motion to extend the TRO, claiming that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims and that the Plaintiffs have failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits.\nThat same day, the Court ordered the extension of the TROs until Apr. 12.\nUpdate 14: On Mar. 28, Plaintiffs submitted a motion and memorandum for a preliminary injunction with exhibits including an \u201cAlien Enemy Validation Guide,\u201d allegedly used by the government.\nUpdate 15: On Mar. 31, the Plaintiffs filed a response to the Defendants\u2019 invocation of the state secrets privilege, claiming that the Court already has the information it needs to conclude that its Mar. 15 oral and written TROs were violated, and that the Plaintiffs are unaware of any case in which the state secrets privilege has been invoked to withhold evidence from a court seeking to enforce its own orders.\nUpdate 16: On Mar. 31, the Plaintiffs filed a reply to the Defendants\u2019 response to an order to show cause, claiming that the Defendants violated the Court\u2019s orders to return to the U.S. all airplanes that were going to take off or were in the air with persons potentially subject to the Alien Enemies Act.\nUpdate 17: On Apr. 1, the Defendants filed an opposition to the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, claiming Plaintiffs\u2019 motion is procedurally barred and fails on the merits.\nUpdate 18: On Apr. 4, the Plaintiffs filed a reply to the Defendants\u2019 opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. In their reply, Plaintiffs requested that the Court also find the President\u2019s Proclamation to be unlawful even if the process was provided to contest its applicability to an individual.\nUpdate 19: On Apr. 7, the Supreme Court. In a 5-4 decision, vacated the district court\u2019s TROs holding that the case should have been brought as a habeas case where the plaintiffs were in custody at the time. The Court also stated, \u201cnotice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.\u201d\nUpdate 20: On Apr. 16, Judge Boasberg issued an order holding that there\u2019s probable cause to find the Defendants acted with criminal contempt in violating his orders. He offered the government to stave off a criminal referral by \u201cpurging\u201d the contempt. He wrote, \u201cThe most obvious way for Defendants to do so here is by asserting custody of the individuals who were removed in violation of the Court\u2019s classwide TRO so that they might avail themselves of their right to challenge their removability through a habeas proceeding.\u201d The defendants appealed his decision to the DC Circuit.\nOn the same day, the Plaintiffs submitted a new motion for a TRO asking the court to direct the government to provide 30 days\u2019 notice before seeking to remove any class member under the AEA. The Plaintiffs also stated that they intend to amend their complaint \u201cto reinstate their habeas claim on behalf of class members detained in CECOT and to seek the return of these Plaintiffs to the United States.\u201d\nUpdate 21: On Friday, Apr. 18, Plaintiffs submitted an emergency motion for immediate ruling on the TRO motion. Plaintiffs alleged at the time of filing that \u201cindividuals have already been loaded on to[sic] buses\u201d in the Northern District of Texas for deportation under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nAt an emergency hearing, Judge Boasberg denied the motion on jurisdictional grounds.\n\nUpdate 22: On Apr. 18, the DC Circuit, in a 2-1 decision, issued an administrative stay in the appeal from Judge Boasberg\u2019s Apr. 16 contempt-related order.\nUpdate 23: On Apr. 24, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which includes a habeas petition for the class of individuals who have already been removed to El Salvador. The following day, Apr. 25, the plaintiffs submitted a motion for a permanent injunction and a memorandum in support.\nUpdate 24: On May 1, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 Apr. 25 motion for a preliminary injunction in which they suggest that the United States has and will continue to provide procedural due process and that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims fail on the merits.\nUpdate 25: On May 5, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction, urging the court to grant the motion because of the likelihood on the merits of their claims and the grave harm faced by Plaintiffs as they remain in CECOT.\nUpdate 26: On June 4, Judge Boasberg issued an order and memorandum opinion. The court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification of the detainees in CECOT prison and a preliminary injunction stating: \"The Government must facilitate the Class\u2019s ability to seek habeas relief to contest their removal under the Act.\" However, Judge Boasberg held that the detainees are not currently in the \u201cconstructive custody\u201d of the United States for the present purposes of habeas. He also denied class certification for individuals held in the United States in criminal custody.\nUpdate 27: A federal appeals court ruled on June 10 that the administration does not have to comply with a lower court\u2019s order directing the government to give due process to Venezuelan immigrants who were deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act authority.\nUpdate 28: On June 10, the Defendants filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals to the District of Columbia Circuit.\nUpdate 29: On June 17, the Defendants filed another notice of appeal to the D.C.

Trump (a.k.a. A.A.R.P. v. Trump) (N.D. Texas)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00059Habeas Petition2025-04-16Overview:  President Trump issued a presidential proclamation purporting to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to allow for summary removal of alleged members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang. A class of individuals in US immigration custody seek a writ of habeas corpus to prevent their removal to El Salvador and a declaration that the presidential proclamation is unlawful. The court denied petitioners\u2019 initial request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) on Apr. 17 and petitioners filed a renewed emergency TRO request on Apr. 18. \nOn May 16, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked the government\u2019s removal of  the putative class of individuals under the Alien Enemies Act while the litigation proceeds, and asked the lower court to define the scope of due process required, which was more than the government\u2019s current practice.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 14, President Trump signed a Proclamation purporting to invoke the authority of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to summarily deport Venezuelan nationals alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang.\nOn Apr. 16, two Venezuelan individuals using the pseudonyms A.A.R.P. and W.M.M. who are in U.S. immigration custody, filed a habeas petition against Respondents-Defendants Trump, the Department of Homeland Security and others. A.A.R.P and W.M.M. claim to be at imminent risk of removal under the AEA. They ask that the court grant class certification and issue a temporary restraining order to prevent Respondents from transferring Petitioners and similarly situated persons from the district while this suit is ongoing. \nPetitioners argue that the government's actions exceed its authority. They claim the government\u2019s actions violate the Immigration and Naturalization Act which provides a \u201csole basis\u201d for such removals, provisions for applying for asylum and withholding, and statutory protection against being sent to a country where they could face torture. Furthermore, they claim their removal would violate the Fifth Amendment due process clause and the right to habeas.\nPetitioners also ask the court to declare the President\u2019s Proclamation unlawful, grant a writ of habeas corpus enjoining Respondents from removing Petitioners from the district pursuant to the Proclamation, and prevent Respondents from applying the Proclamation to Respondents without giving 30-days\u2019 advance notice and opportunity to respond. They argue that the Proclamation is unlawful and that the court\u2019s intervention is necessary so that Petitioners and the putative class are not unlawfully sent to a Salvadoran prison pursuant to the Proclamation.\n\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 17, Judge James Wesley Hendrix denied the Petitioners\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order. Judge wrote, \u201cThe United States answered unequivocally, stating that \u2018the government does not presently expect to remove A.A.R.P. or W.M.M. under the [Aliens Enemies Act] until after the pending habeas petition is resolved\u2019 and that \u2018[i]f that changes, we will update the Court.\u2019\u201d The court reserved a decision on class certification.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 18, Petitioners submitted a renewed emergency TRO request. Petitioners state, \u201cofficers at Bluebonnet have distributed notices under the Alien Enemies Act, in English only, that designate Venezuelan men for removal under the AEA, and have told the men that the removals are imminent and will happen tonight or tomorrow\u201d (emphasis in original).\n\nPlaintiffs also submitted an appeal at the same time to the Fifth Circuit as an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe district court rejected the motion on the ground that the appeal removed their ability to rule on it.\nUpdate 3: On late Friday night, Apr. 18, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the emergency appeal on the grounds that the appeal\u2019s timeline was unreasonable. On Saturday, Apr. 19, the Supreme Court issued a stay writing, \u201cThe Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court.\u201d Justice Alito and Thomas dissented.\nUpdate 4: On May 9, Judge Hendrix denied class certification.\n\nUpdate 5: On May 16, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a per curiam decision. recognized the putative class in the Northern District of Texas and held that \u201cnotice roughly 24 hours before removal, devoid of information about how to exercise due process rights to contest that removal, surely does not pass muster\u201d under the Fifth Amendment. The Court remanded the case to the Fifth Circuit to address \u201c(1) all the normal preliminary injunction factors, including likelihood of success on the merits, as to the named plaintiffs\u2019 underlying habeas claims that the AEA does not authorize their removal pursuant to the President\u2019s March 14, 2025, Proclamation, and (2) the issue of what notice is due, as to the putative class\u2019s due process claims against summary removal.\u201d The Court enjoined the government from removing putative class members pending the outcome of the litigation.\n\nJustices Alito and Thomas dissented on procedural grounds.2025-05-16\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Alien Enemies Act removals (Presidential Proclamation 10903)J.O.P. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security (D. Md.)\n\nCivil Action No. 8:19-CV-01944-SAGMotion to enforce Apr. 14, 2025\n\n(Original complaint filed July 1, 2019)\n2025-04-14Overview:  Plaintiff, a 20-year-old from Venezuela with a pending asylum application, was removed to El Salvador in March 2025. On April 15, he filed an emergency motion to enforce a settlement agreement reached between a class of similarly situated asylum seekers, including the Plaintiff, and the Defendants. The agreement provides that a group of unaccompanied minors who enter the United States and seek asylum cannot be removed from the United States prior to the final determination of their asylum claim. On April 23, the Court granted the motion and held that Defendants violated the agreement by removing Plaintiff should at a minimum \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return to the United States. On May 6, the Court stayed the portion of her agreement pertaining to his return pending appeal to the Fourth Circuit, setting a deadline of May 8 for Defendants to appeal. The Defendants appealed, and the appeals court upheld the district court order while the case is on appeal..\nCase Summary: On July 1, 2019, four undocumented immigrants who were determined to be an \u201cUnaccompanied Alien Child\u201d (UAC) when entering the United States and later sought asylum sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), claiming that recent policy modifications by the USCIS governing treatment of an asylum application by a UAC violated the APA, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Due Process Clause. \nThe Court entered a temporary restraining order which was then converted into a preliminary injunction, and the parties reached a final settlement agreement (Settlement Agreement) which was approved by the court on Nov. 25, 2024. The Settlement Agreement provided that the government cannot remove a certified class of UAC asylum seekers, whose asylum application is pending with USCIS, before the final resolution of the application by USCIS.\nOn March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a Proclamation titled Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de Aragua,(TdA) which asserted that under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), any Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA can be apprehended, detained, and removed. \nPlaintiff is a 20-year-old Class Member from Venezuela who was determined by federal immigration officials to be a UAC when he entered the U.S. He filed an asylum application with the USCIS in December 2022 when he was 18, which remains pending. ICE took him into custody in January 2025 and commenced removal proceedings against him. At a hearing on March 26, the immigration judge continued his removal proceedings and scheduled a hearing for May 2025. However, on April 11 the Defendants informed his counsel that he had been removed to El Salvador on March 15. \nDefendants argued that the Plaintiff was not a Class Member by virtue of being subject to the AEA and thus not eligible for asylum. On Apr. 14, counsel for the Class Members filed an Emergency Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement, with accompanying Memorandum in Support, seeking to remedy the alleged violation of the Agreement by the return of the Plaintiff and to prevent any such further violations with respect to other Class Members.\nUpdate 1: On April 16 Plaintiffs also filed an Emergency Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order seeking to prevent the imminent removal of another Class Member, an 18-yr-old from Venezuela who was detained on March 19, after Defendants failed to confirm to that they would not be removing the Plaintiff Class Member. Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher granted the TRO on April 16 after Defendants stated their position that they would not agree to not removing any Class Member until after the Motion to Enforce was resolved.\nUpdate 2: On April 17 Class Counsel moved to extend the TRO to the entire class. On the same day Defendants filed their Opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Enforce.\nUpdate 3: On April 23, the court granted the Motion to Enforce, ruling that removal of a Class Member who has not received final adjudication on the merits by USCIS of a properly filed asylum application is a violation of the Agreement. The Judge concluded that the case is a contractual dispute over the Settlement Agreement over which it retains jurisdiction, that the Class does not exclude individuals subject to the AEA, and that removal pursuant to the AEA does not qualify as a final order of removal within the meaning of the Agreement. Judge Stephanie Gallagher held that the Defendants are obligated to return or at a minimum \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of the Plaintiff and any other removed Class Members to the United States and stated that facilitating includes, but is not limited to Defendants making a good faith request to the government of El Salvador to release the Plaintiff to U.S. custody for transport back to the United States to await the adjudication of his asylum application on the merits by USCIS.\nUpdate 4: On May 4, Defendants filed a Motion to Vacate or in the Alternative to Stay Pending Appeal the portion of the Judge\u2019s order requiring the return of Plaintiff, Section 2. They also filed a motion to seal the Memorandum in Support, on the basis that it contains confidential information. (The Judge granted in part and denied in part the motion to seal, allowing it to be produced with redactions.) In the Memorandum, Defendants state that ICIS issued an Indicative Asylum Decision on May 1 which determined that if the Plaintiff returned, his asylum application would be denied based on Terrorist-Related Inadmissibility Grounds (TRIG) due to his alleged connection to TdA and as a matter of discretion. For this reason, they argue that the section of the Court\u2019s order directing them to return the Plaintiff is now effectively moot.\nUpdate 5: On May 5, the Court denied in part and granted in part the Motion to Vacate or in the Alternative to Stay, denying the motion to vacate but granting the motion to stay Section 2 until May 8 to allow Defendants to file an appeal. During a hearing, the Judge reportedly noted that even if the government ultimately plans to reject the asylum claim it must do so using the correct process in the U.S. courts and \u201ccan\u2019t skip to the end.\u201d\nUpdate 6: On May 7, the government appealed to the Fourth Circuit and on May 8, the Fourth Circuit granted an administrative stay while it considers the issue.\nUpdate 7: On May 19, the Fourth Circuit, in a 2-1 decision, denied the government\u2019s request for a stay pending appeal.\nUpdate 8: On July 8, Judge Gallagher took judicial notice of a filing of a U.N. report reflecting El Salvador\u2019s disavowal of any \u201csovereign interest\u201d in detaining foreign individuals. The court ordered the administration to explain why it continues to claim \u201cdiplomatic discussion\u201d would be necessary to facilitate the plaintiff\u2019s return. 2025-07-08\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Alien Enemies Act removals (Presidential Proclamation 10903)A.S.R. v. Trump (W.D. Pa)\n\nCase No: 3:25-cv-00113Habeas Petition2025-04-15Overview:  On March 14, President Trump issued a presidential proclamation purporting to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to allow for summary removal of alleged members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang. A class of individuals in US immigration custody in the Western District of Pennsylvania seek a writ of habeas corpus to prevent their removal to El Salvador and a declaration that the presidential proclamation is unlawful. This class asserts the Trump Administration\u2019s proclamation is an action in excess of the administration\u2019s authority in violation of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA), Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA), several provisions of the Immigration & Nationality Act (INA), Fifth Amendment Due Process Right, and right to Habeas Corpus. In a temporary order, the court found the presidential proclamation complies with the AEA but that the government needs to give individuals three week's notice and an opportunity to be heard before removal. This case has been paused pending further update from the court after A.S.R. notified the court that he accepted a final order of removal to Venezuela as of June 26, 2025.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 14, President Trump signed a Proclamation purporting to invoke the authority of the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to summarily deport Venezuelan nationals alleged to be members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang. On Apr. 15, a Venezuelan individual using the pseudonym A.S.R., who is in U.S. immigration custody, filed a habeas petition against Respondents-Defendants Trump, the Department of Homeland Security and others. A.S.R. claims to be at imminent risk of removal under the AEA and asks that the court grant class certification to others in a similarly-situated position in the Western District of Pennsylvania, issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent Respondents from transferring members of the class from the district while the suit is ongoing, and declare the Proclamation unlawful. A.S.R. argues the Proclamation and its implementation are ultra vires actions in excess of the Trump Administration\u2019s authority under the AEA. A.S.R. also alleges the implementation of the proclamation is in violation of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (FARRA), several provisions of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA), the Fifth Amendment Due Process right, and the right to petition for habeas corpus. An emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) was filed by A.S.R. on the same day the petition was filed, which was immediately granted by Judge Stephanie Haines.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 16, A.S.R. submitted a notice that he had been transferred out of the Western District of Pennsylvania to a detention center in Texas, despite his transfer taking place after the filing of his habeas corpus petition.\nOn that same day, the Trump Administration responded in opposition to A.S.R.\u2019s motion for a TRO. On Apr. 17, Judge Haines extended the TRO until Apr. 29.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 25 A.S.R. filed a motion to extend the TRO by an additional 14 days.\nJudge Haines granted this motion on the same day, extending the TRO through May 13, and also certified the class. The TRO blocks the Trump Administration from transferring A.S.R. out of the Northern District of Texas and the members of the certified class from the Western District of Pennsylvania pursuant to the AEA.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 29, the class filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and supporting memorandum, requesting that the court order A.S.R.\u2019s return to the Western District of Pennsylvania and enjoin the Trump Administration from removing A.S.R. and any member of the class from the country under the AEA.\nUpdate 4: On May 1, the Trump Administration filed its opposition to the preliminary injunction motion, arguing A.S.R. lacks standing to bring the claims and is unlikely to succeed on the merits of his claims. The  Plaintiffs replied in support of their motion on May 2.\nUpdate 5: On May 13, Judge Stephanie Haines issued a preliminary injunction finding the presidential proclamation complies with the AEA but that the government needs to give individuals three week notice and an opportunity to be heard before removal. \nUpdate 6: On July 8, the District Court stayed A.S.R.\u2019s case pending further notice from the court after A.S.R. notified the Court that he accepted a final order of removal to Venezuela as of June 26, 2025.2025-07-08\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Alien Enemies Act removals (Presidential Proclamation 10903)W.J.C.C. v.

On May 21, a Venezuelan individual using the pseudonym W.J.C.C., who is in U.S. immigration custody, filed a habeas petition against Respondents-Defendants Trump and the Trump Administration. W.J.C.C. claims to be at imminent risk of removal under the AEA and asks that the court issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent Respondents from transferring W.J.C.C. from the district while the suit is ongoing, and declare the Proclamation unlawful. W.J.C.C. argues the Proclamation and its implementation is in violation of W.J.C.C.\u2019s Fifth Amendment Due Process Right.\nUpdate 1: On May 22, Judge Stephanie Haines granted a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 2: On June 4, Judge Haines extended the TRO through June 19, 2025.\nUpdate 3: On June 18, Judge Stephanie Haines restated her holding in A.S.R. v. Trump (Case no. 3:25-cv-00113) that the presidential proclamation is a valid exercise of the AEA. Judge Haines, however, granted a preliminary injunction in favor of W.J.C.C. rejecting the government\u2019s claim that it could apply shortened notice akin to expedited removal procedures. The court held that the petitioner was entitled to: \u201c(1) twenty-one (21) days' notice and an \"opportunity to be heard,\" (2) notice that clearly articulates the fact that he is subject to removal under the Proclamation and the AEA, (3) notice in English and Spanish, the language of the one sought to be expelled, and if needed, Spanish-to-English interpreters shall be provided for any necessary hearings, and (4) notice of all of the foregoing to his counsel.\u201d The court denied the petitioner\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction that would have barred the government from transferring him out of the district.2025-06-18\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Alien Enemies Act removals (Presidential Proclamation 10903)M.A.P.S. v.

On June 9, the court entered final judgment in favor of the class.\nCase Summary:  The Trump administration issued a Proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) authorizing immediate removal of noncitizens who the government claims are members of Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua (TdA). Petitioner was arrested by ICE despite an active Temporary Protected Status and served with a document alleging that she is a TdA member, an allegation she denies. On May 10, Petitioner brought a habeas petition to challenge the Proclamation\u2019s application against her. She also seeks to represent a class of similarly-situated individuals who also seek to challenge the Proclamation\u2019s application against them. Petitioner is seeking relief to avoid being sent to a Salvadoran prison or other location where she contends she is  likely to face indefinite imprisonment, persecution or harm. The Petitioner challenges the legality of the AEA on multiple counts and seeks to enjoin the application of the AEA process to her and the class. Specifically, she asserts that the Proclamation is ultra vires; violates the removal proceeding requirements, asylum process withholding of removal process of the Immigration and Naturalization Act; violates the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (\u201cFARRA\u201d); violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process clause; and that the summary removal of the class violates Habeas Corpus.\nUpdate 1: On May 13, Judge David Briones granted a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 2: On May 22, Judge Briones granted the Petitioner\u2019s motion for class certification, ruling that she is now representative of \u201ca class of all non-citizens in custody in the Western District of Texas who were, are or would be subject to\u201d the Proclamation or its implementation.\nUpdate 3: On June 9, Judge Briones granted a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 4: On June 9, Judge Briones found that the administration\u2019s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act was illegal, declining to \u201cstretch the AEA\u2019s meaning so broadly that mass migration or criminal activities by some members of a particular nationality could qualify as an \u2018invasion.\u2019\u201d The court\u2019s ruling blocks deportations under the Act in the Western District of Texas. 2025-06-09\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Alien Enemies Act removals (Presidential Proclamation 10903)Sanchez Puentes v. Garite (W.D. Tex.)\n\nCase no. 3:25-cv-00127Habeas Petition2025-04-16Overview:  Two Venezuelan nationals holding Temporary Protected Status brought a habeas petition challenging their confinement and designation as \u201calien enemies\u201d due to alleged associations with Tren de Aragua. They seek habeas relief and release from custody. On Apr. 25 the court granted a TRO and ordered the Petitioners' release from custody. The court entered final judgment for the case in favor of the Petitioners on June 13.\nCase Summary: The Trump administration issued a Proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act authorizing immediate removal of noncitizens who the government claims are members of Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua. Petitioners Luddis Norelia Sanchez Garcia and Julio Cesar Sanchez Puentes are a married couple who immigrated to the United States in 2022, residing with Temporary Protected Status after they fled from their home nation of Venezuela. In early 2025, the Trump administration rescinded TPS for all Venezuelans. Shortly thereafter, the petitioners were arrested. The Petitioners brought a habeas petition on Apr. 16, where they allege that their confinement is unlawful and their designation as \u201calien enemies\u201d due to alleged associations with the Tren de Aragua violates due process as it lacks a factual basis. They seek habeas relief and release from custody. \nUpdate 1: On Apr. 17, Judge David Briones granted a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 25, Judge Briones ordered the release of petitioners. He also ordered the government not to deport anyone subject to the AEA within the district, and to provide three-weeks notice for detention under the AEA.\nUpdate 3: On May 13, Judge Briones granted the government\u2019s request to stay the district-wide relief granted in the Apr. 25 order pending appeal.\nUpdate 4: On June 13, Judge Briones entered an order granting the relief of the petitioners and granting the petitioners\u2019 Amended Verified Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus and Request for Order to Show Cause.2025-06-13\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Alien Enemies Act removals (Presidential Proclamation 10903)Agelviz-Sanguino v.

Texas)\n\nCase No. 4:25-cv-02116Habeas petition (under seal)2025-05-09Case Summary: On March 14, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order, Proclamation No. 10903, through which he invoked the Alien Enemies Act (the \u201cAEA\u201d), to authorize and direct the immediate removal of Venezuelan nationals that are alleged members of Tren de Aragua. Petitioner Widmer Josneyder Agelviz Sanguino is a Venezuelan citizen who traveled to the US in September 2024 as part of a US refugee resettlement program, and was detained allegedly because of his tattoos that indicated membership in Tren de Aragua. Petitioner was deported to El Salvador.\nUpdate 1: On May 19, following a hearing, District Court Judge Keith Ellison issued an order granting Plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion. Among other actions, it states: \u201cIf Defendants claim an inability to facilitate communication due to lack of control over El Salvadoran facilities, they must:\ni. Set forth in a declaration all efforts made to secure cooperation, including through diplomatic or contractual channels.\nii. Disclose all agreements or arrangements with El Salvador (or any agency or sub-division otherwise involved) related to Agelviz-Sanguino\u2019s detention, including any memoranda of understanding with, or funding ties to CECOT.\u201d\nUpdate 2: On May 21, Judge Ellison issued an order requiring supplemental information by the government. \u201cDefendants\u2019 declaration provided no meaningful information regarding Plaintiff Agelviz-Sanguino\u2019s location, health, or the legal basis for his detention,\u201d the court wrote.\nUpdate 3: On May 22, the government appealed, and, on May 23, the Fifth Circuit issued an administrative stay pending appeal.\nUpdate 4: On May 23, the District Court case was voluntarily dismissed and on May 27, the appeal was dismissed.2025-05-27\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Alien Enemies Act removals (Presidential Proclamation 10903)Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan v. Trump (C.D. Ca.)\n\nCase No. 5:25-cv-01207Habeas petition (under seal)2025-05-17Overview:  A Venezuelan asylum seeker alleged to be a Tren de Aragua member brought a habeas petition challenging the application of the Alien Enemies Act to him and a class of similarly situated individuals.The court has temporarily blocked his removal until the government provides notice and due process, but the court also ruled in favor of the government on the legal foundation of the Alien Enemies Act Proclamation.\nCase Summary: On March 14, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order, Proclamation No. 10903, through which he invoked the Alien Enemies Act (the \u201cAEA\u201d), to authorize and direct the immediate removal of Venezuelan nationals that are alleged members of Tren de Aragua. Petitioner Darwin Antonio Arevalo is a Venezuelan citizen applying for asylum in the US who was granted a work authorization and residency permit to allow him to remain in the US while his asylum application was pending. During a scheduled ICE check-in, Petitioner was arrested and placed in detention at the Desert View Annex or Desert View Modified Community Correctional Facility. The government did not provide Petitioner with prior notice of his arrest nor serve \nhim with a warrant or other documentation regarding the basis for his arrest, but Petitioner was informed that his arrest was premised upon his status as a Venezuelan with tattoos, which could indicate that Petitioner had affiliations with Tren de Aragua. Petitioner filed a habeas petition asserting claims based on the US Constitution, California Constitution, and various federal statutes. He also filed applications for class certification and a temporary restraining order, seeking, among other things, to prevent his removal under Trump\u2019s proclamation and transfer out of the Central District of California. \nUpdate 1: On May 19, Judge John Holcomb certified a class of noncitizens in the district subject to the AEA and granted a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 2: On June 2, Judge Holcolm granted a preliminary injunction stopping the government from deporting certain the petitioner and a certified class, until further order from the court on required legal notice and process. The court, however, also ruled that petitioners are unlikely to succeed on their claim that the president\u2019s Alien Enemies Act proclamation is unlawful.\nUpdate 3: On June 20, Judge Holcomb denied petitioners\u2019 ex parte application for a writ of habeas corpus, noting petitioner\u2019s detention remains permissible under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) because of the government\u2019s intention to appeal the grant of relief in petitioner\u2019s removal proceedings (since petitioners can remain in custody pending such appeals).2025-06-20\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Alien Enemies Act removals (Presidential Proclamation 10903)Y.A.P.A v.

Md.)\n\nCase No. 8:25-cv-00951\n\nFourth Circuit Case No. 25-1345\n\nSupreme Court Docket No. 24A949Complaint2025-03-24Overview: Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia (Abrego Garcia) and his family sued several government officials alleging his Mar. 15 deportation to El Salvador without judicial proceedings was in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Withholding of Removal Statute, and the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs allege the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE paid the government of El Salvador to incarcerate 261 U.S. noncitizens, including Abrego Garcia, who were deported on Mar. 15. Abrego Garcia and his family request that the government\u2019s actions be declared a violation of the Fifth Amendment and that the Court order the government to work with the government of El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia to U.S. custody. At the heart of his claim is that he was under court protection barring his removal to El Salvador, and the government has acknowledged his removal was an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d The district court has ordered his return to the United States, and the Court of Appeals has affirmed that order. The district court has also rejected the Trump Administration\u2019s motion to further delay answering questions about its removal of Abrego Garcia and what steps, if any, it has taken to secure his return.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 15, the U.S. government deported 261 noncitizens to El Salvador. Among those removed was Plaintiff Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia (Abrego Garcia), who had been granted immigration relief in 2019 through withholding of removal to El Salvador on the ground that he had a well-grounded fear of persecution. Plaintiffs include Abrego Garcia, his U.S. citizen wife, and his child. Plaintiffs allege the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ICE provided substantial financial compensation to the Government of El Salvador to incarcerate Abrego Garcia and the other noncitizens deported with him. Plaintiffs contend that the removal of Abrego Garcia to El Salvador constitutes a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Withholding of Removal Statute, and the procedural and substantive due process rights safeguarded under the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly, plaintiffs seek a judicial declaration affirming that the removal of Abrego Garcia was unconstitutional. They further request that the court direct the defendants to cease compensating El Salvador for the detention of Abrego Garcia and order the defendants to formally request the release of Abrego Garcia to U.S. custody, and take all reasonable measures to facilitate his return to the United States in the event El Salvador fails to comply.\nPlaintiffs immediately filed an emergency motion seeking a temporary restraining order (TRO) urging the court to immediately prohibit the defendants from continuing payments to the Government of El Salvador for Abrego Garcia's detention and to require the defendants to initiate efforts to secure his return to U.S. custody.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 25, Judge Paula Xinis denied Plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion for a TRO. \nOn that same day, Plaintiffs filed a second motion for a TRO against the Defendants requesting injunctive relief in the form of a court order preventing Defendants from continuing to financially support El Salvador\u2019s detention of Abrego Garcia and ordering Defendants to request the return of Abrego Garcia to U.S. custody.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 28, Plaintiffs filed a supplemental memorandum in support of the requested injunctive relief.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 31, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion for a TRO. The Defendants state it was an \u201cadministrative error\u201d to have removed Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, but oppose the relief that Plaintiffs request.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 4, Judge Paula Xinis wrote that \u201cissuance of a preliminary injunction without further delay is necessary \u2026 to avoid ongoing irreparable harm,\u201d and ordered the government to effectuate his return to the United States by 11:59PM Apr. 7. The judge published a memorandum opinion on Apr. 6. \nUpdate 5: The Defendants appealed the order, and on the morning of Apr. 7, the Fourth Circuit denied the Defendants\u2019 request for a stay. The Defendants petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to vacate the district court order and an immediate administrative stay. Chief Justice Roberts issued a temporary stay and ordered the Plaintiff to submit a reply by 5pm ET the following day. The Plaintiff, however, submitted their reply shortly afterwards on the same day. \nUpdate 6: On the evening of Apr. 10, the Supreme Court, in a per curiam opinion without any dissent, upheld the district court order in large part. The Court wrote: \u201cThe order properly requires the Government to \u2018facilitate\u2019 Abrego Garcia\u2019s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador. The intended scope of the term \u2018effectuate\u2019 in the District Court\u2019s order is, however, unclear, and may exceed the District Court\u2019s authority.\u201d\nWithin hours, the district court issued an order \u201cto DIRECT that Defendants take all available steps to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia to the United States as soon as possible.\u201d The order also required the government to provide a declaration with information of Abrego Garcia\u2019s current location and steps taken to facilitate his return.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 11, Defendants submitted a Response to the Order stating that the government could not provide information in response to the Apr. 10 order by the designated time of 9:30AM ET on Apr. 11.\nAfter a hearing in which the government did not provide answers, the judge issued an Order stating \u201ccounsel [for the Defendant] could not confirm, and thus did not advance any evidence, that Defendants had done anything to facilitate Abrego Garcia\u2019s return. This remained Defendants\u2019 position even after this Court reminded them that the Supreme Court of the United States expressly affirmed this Court\u2019s authority to require the Government \u2018facilitate\u2019 Abrego Garcia\u2019s return\u201d (emphasis in original). The order requires the Defendant to provide a daily update of actions taken to facilitate his return.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 12, the government submitted a declaration stating only that \u201cAbrego Garcia is currently being held in the Terrorism Confinement Center in El Salvador. He is alive and secure in that facility. He is detained pursuant to the sovereign, domestic authority of El Salvador.\u201d\nEarlier that day Plaintiffs submitted a motion for additional relief including expedited discovery. \nUpdate 9: On Apr. 13, the Defendants provided a daily status report, which included no information on efforts to obtain his release from custody in El Salvador. The Defendants also submitted a motion opposing the Plaintiffs\u2019 Apr. 12 motion for additional relief. The motion also stated, \u201cDefendants understand \u2018facilitate\u2019 to mean \u2026 actions allowing an alien to enter the United States \u2026 best read as taking all available steps to remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien\u2019s ability to return here\u201d (emphasis in original).\nUpdate 10: On Apr. 15, Judge Xinis granted the motion for expedited discovery. The Judge wrote, \u201cDefendants therefore remain obligated, at a minimum, to take the steps available to them toward\naiding, assisting, or making easier Abrego Garcia\u2019s release from custody in El Salvador and\nresuming his status quo ante. But the record reflects that Defendants have done nothing at all.\u201d\nUpdate 11: On Apr. 16, the Defendants submitted a notice of appeal.\nUpdate 12: On Apr. 17, the Fourth Circuit denied the Defendant\u2019s appeal in a 7-page order, which concluded that the Defendants\u2019 requested relief is both extraordinary and premature in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\nUpdate 13: On Apr. 23, Defendants filed a sealed motion to stay discovery, which Judge Xinis granted through Apr. 30 with the agreement of the parties. On Apr. 30, Judge Xinis denied Defendants\u2019 motion to stay discovery and ordered a new expedited schedule.\nUpdate 14: On May 16, following a hearing, Judge Xinis ordered the unsealing of Secretary Rubio's Declaration asserting state secrets and for the government to supplement the Declaration by May 23.\nUpdate 15: On June 26, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia filed an emergency motion today asking the district court in Maryland to order his return to Maryland and bar any attempts to remove him to another district or outside the United States. Garcia cites the Supreme Court\u2019s recent order to \u201c[ensure] that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\u201d\nNote: On June 25, 2025, in a related criminal case, Judge Crenshaw rejected the government\u2019s request to keep Kilmar Abrego Garcia detained while he awaits trial on immigrant smuggling charges.\"\nUpdate 16: Following a hearing on July 7, Judge Xinis ordered the administration to produce testimony on whether it intends to deport Abrego Garcia if he is released from criminal detention due to a separate criminal case and the legal basis for any such removal. \nUpdate 17: The administration informed the court yesterday that it will not deport Mr. Abrego Garcia to El Salvador without first reopening his immigration proceedings and terminating his current status. The government added that, if it proceeds with deportation to a third country, it would follow the procedures outlined in DHS\u2019s guidance. Abrego Garcia refused to stipulate jointly. On July 7, Judge Xinis denied the administration\u2019s two motions to dismiss the case as moot and lacking jurisdiction. Garcia argued that the administration will return to its actions as alleged in his complaint. The administration made this stipulation hoping to counter the plaintiff\u2019s argument that this current case is not moot.2025-07-09\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Removal to El Salvador/Fear of PersecutionGil Rojas v. Venegas (S.D. Tex.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00056Habeas Petition 2025-03-14Overview:  Adrian Gil Rojas, a Venezuelan national who holds Temporary Protected Status (TPS) under 8 U.S.C. 1254a, has challenged his detention by government officials, asserting that it is unlawful and unconstitutional. On April 2, Judge Rolando Olvera ordered Rojas released and returned to New York and said he would not be subject to removal.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 21, 2025, Adrian Gil Rojas, a Venezuelan national, was taken into custody at his home by agents of U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE). Rojas had arrived in the United States on or about April 30, 2023 and was granted temporary protected status (TPS) on Nov. 27, 2023. He was subject to an in absentia removal order from Sept. 10, 2024 after he missed a court appointment, but on March 11, 2025 he filed a motion to rescind this order. \nOn March 14, he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, asserting that his detention is unlawful because of his TPS status under 8 U.S.C. 1254a (a)(1)(A). He also asserted that his submission of a motion to rescind his in absentia motion triggered an automatic stay of his removal from the U.S. under 8 U.S.C. 1229a(b)(5)(C). He asked the court to release him immediately and declare his detention unlawful and unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment, and enjoin his further removal or detention so long as he continues to hold TPS status and/or his motion to rescind remains pending under the Fifth Amendment.\nUpdate: On Apr. 2, Judge Rolando Olvera ordered the government to return Gil Rojas to New York to be released on his own recognizance.2025-04-02\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Removal to El Salvador/Fear of PersecutionRobert F. Kennedy Human Rights v. Department of State (D.D.C.) \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01774\nComplaint 2025-06-05Overview:  Immigration and criminal defense organizations filed a lawsuit challenging the agreement between the United States and El Salvador involving the transfer of individuals from U.S. soil to El Salvador\u2019s notorious CECOT prison. The complaint alleges that the U.S. government pays El Salvador to house these individuals, effectively outsourcing detention in facilities known for human rights abuses. Plaintiffs argue the agreement violates the First, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments, among other claims.\nCase Summary: In February 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the U.S. had made an agreement with El Salvador whereby the U.S. would pay El Salvador to hold in Salvadorian prisons immigrants who had come to the U.S. illegally and who had been convicted of crimes. Plaintiffs are four immigration non-profits and one criminal defense non-profit who represent individuals in immigration and criminal cases. Plaintiffs sued Secretary Rubio and the United States Department of State, alleging that the deal between the U.S. and El Salvador has resulted in many individuals being sent to a Salvadorian prison known as CECOT, where inmates are subjected to human rights violations and are not allowed any contact with the outside world, including counsel. Plaintiffs assert that the agreement harms their organizations because it renders it impossible for Plaintiffs to provide legal services and advice to clients who have been transferred to CECOT because the organizations are no longer able to contact these clients. Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that the agreement has forced them to devote significant time and resources to new training and procedures that they would not otherwise have had to expend in the absence of the agreement. Plaintiffs brought claims arguing that the agreement violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it is contrary to the Suspension Clause, Appropriations Clause, First, Fifth, Sixth, and Eight Amendments, the Convention Against Torture, the Case-Zablocki Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Non-Detention Act, the Detainee Treatment Act, and the First Step Act, as well as various federal regulations. Plaintiffs also allege that the agreement violates the APA because it is both arbitrary and capricious and in excess of statutory authority, and finally that the agreement was made ultra vires. Plaintiffs have asked the court to declare unlawful and set aside the agreement and enjoin Defendants from taking further action pursuant to the agreement.2025-06-05\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Removal to El Salvador/Fear of PersecutionMelgar-Salmeron v.

Md.)\n\nCase No. 8:25-cv-00201-DLB\n\nFourth Circuit Case No. 25-1153Complaint2025-01-21Overview: CASA and Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (two immigrant rights organizations) and a group of noncitizen pregnant women whose unborn children stand to have their citizenship revoked under President Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Order (\u201cEO\u201d) ending birthright citizenship sued Trump alleging the EO is unconstitutional. A federal court temporarily blocked the EO while the lawsuit is pending on the basis that it likely violates the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourth Circuit denied an appeal from the government, and the government then appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has blocked the nationwide (universal) injunction but that does stop relief for the named plaintiffs. The district court has since ruled favorably for a nationwide class action, but awaits to retain full jurisdiction over the case. \nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s executive order seeks to revoke birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants on the basis that people in the United States illegally are not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d The plaintiffs, including immigrant rights organizations CASA and ASAP, as well as individual immigrant parents, argue that the Executive Order violates the Fourteenth Amendment and federal statute 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a), both of which guarantee citizenship to all persons born in the U.S. The complaint asserts that the executive order exceeds presidential authority and causes irreparable harm by stripping constitutionally protected rights from children born to immigrants\u200b (e.g., the right to remain in the United States, access public benefits, and participate fully in civic life) and destabilizes their families, potentially leaving children stateless and separating them from their parents\u200b.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 5, 2025, Judge Deborah Boardman issued an opinion granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary nationwide injunction blocking implementation of the birthright citizenship Executive Order.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 13, the Defendants submitted a notice of appeal to the Fourth Circuit.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 28, the Fourth Circuit denied Defendants\u2019 request for a partial stay of the district court\u2019s injunction. \nUpdate 4: On Mar. 13, the Defendants appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court for a partial stay of the district court\u2019s injunction.\nUpdate 5: On June 27, The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to partially stay a lower court injunction against Executive Order 14160, which restricts birthright citizenship. The ruling limits the injunction\u2019s scope to only the litigants in the case. The majority held that federal courts likely lack authority to issue universal injunctions absent \u201cequitable authority\u201d given by Congress. However, the Court left open whether broader relief might be permitted in class actions or where needed for \u201ccomplete relief.\u201d  Following the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, some of the plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint and emergency motion for class-wide injunctive relief against the birthright citizenship order.\nUpdate 6: On June 27, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which included additional plaintiffs and removed President Donald Trump as a defendant while adding the Director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) as a defendant. The amended complaint also added facts to support Plaintiffs\u2019 legal argument that the EO violated 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(a), as well as class allegations describing how the Plaintiffs meet the procedural requirements for bringing a class action. \nUpdate 7: On July 16, Judge Boardman issued a memorandum opinion and an indicative ruling granting a class-wide injunction pending the district court acquiring jurisdiction on remand from the Fourth Circuit where this part of the litigation is still on appeal.2025-07-16\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Birthright Citizenship (Executive Order 14160)Franco Aleman et al. v.

A federal court temporarily blocked the EO while the lawsuit is pending on the basis that it likely violates the Fourteenth Amendment. Trump has appealed the court\u2019s decision. The Fourth Circuit denied the appeal, and the government then appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has blocked the nationwide (universal) injunction but that does stop relief for the named plaintiffs. \nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s executive order seeks to revoke birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants on the basis that people in the United States illegally are not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d Four states sued to protect residents who would lose their citizenship under the executive order. The suit argues that the plain text of the 14th Amendment, as confirmed in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark (1898), explicitly grants birthright citizenship for all people born in the United States.\nUpdate 1: On Jan. 23, 2025, Judge John Coughenour of the Western District of Washington issued a temporary restraining order against the Executive Order.\nUpdate 2: On Jan. 27, Franco Aleman v.

The lawsuit argues that the EO violates the Constitution, federal statutes, and the Administrative Procedure Act. \nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s executive order (EO) seeks to revoke birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants and for the children of parents on lawful temporary visas on the basis that they are not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States. OCA sued Marco Rubio and the heads of other departments and agencies on behalf of at least two pregnant women expected to give birth to children denied citizenship by the order. Both women reside in the United States on lawful, temporary, nonimmigrant visas. OCA argues that the order violates the plain text of the Fourteenth Amendment, statutes (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401 et seq.), and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2). The suit identifies an injured \u201csubclass\u201d of \u201cTargeted Children\u201d denied the privileges and public benefits afforded to U.S. citizens, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 14, Defendants filed a motion to stay proceedings because the EO at issue is already the subject of three nationwide injunctions, to which the government has sought expedited appeals.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 28, OCA filed its opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to stay and requested that the court deny the vague motion which lacked a specific proposed order.\nUpdate 3: On May 5, Defendants replied in support of their motion to stay.

The lawsuit argues that the EO violates the Constitution, federal statutes, and the Administrative Procedure Act. This case has been stayed while two related cases (Washington v. Trump and New Jersey v. Trump) continue to be litigated. \nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s executive order seeks to revoke birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants and for the children of parents on lawful temporary visas on the basis that they are not \u201csubject to the jurisdiction\u201d of the United States. The County of Santa Clara sued to protect residents who would lose their citizenship or whose U.S.-born children will not receive citizenship and to prevent administrative burdens and loss of tax revenues associated with that prospective loss of citizenship. Santa Clara argues that the order violates the plain text of the Fourteenth Amendment, statutes (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401 et seq.), and the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2), and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 5, Santa Clara County filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prohibit Defendants from implementing or enforcing the birthright citizenship EO on the basis that the EO violates the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, the constitutional Separation of Powers, and the Immigration and Nationality Act.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 14, Defendants filed an opposition to Santa Clara County\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction on the basis that Santa Clara County does not reach threshold grounds and is unlikely to succeed on the merits, and injunctive relief is not in the public interest. \nUpdate 3: On Feb. 19, Santa Clara County filed a reply in support of its motion for a preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 4: On Feb. 21, Judge Eumi Lee ruled that both parties file Orders to Show Cause to explain why this case should not be stayed pending the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Washington v.

V.M.L. was allegedly detained incommunicado alongside her mother and sister by ICE following a routine check-in under the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program. V.M.L.\u2019s custodian brought this habeas petition to secure her release from unlawful detention and deportation as a U.S. citizen. The plaintiffs subsequently dropped the case.\nCase Summary: On Apr. 22, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detained V.M.L., a two-year old United States Citizen, along with her mother and sister following a routine check-in under the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program. The three are believed to be in custody in Alexandria after the mother and sister were served with deportation orders, but V.M.L.\u2019s precise location is unknown to both her father and her custodian. V.M.L.'s custodian brought this habeas petition on Apr. 24 to secure V.M.L.'s release from unlawful detention, alleging this detention is in excess of executive authority and in violation of the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable seizures and Fifth Amendment substantive due process right. The Petitioner immediately filed a motion for an emergency TRO, and the Petitioner filed a reply in further support of this motion the next day, on Apr. 25. The government opposed the motion for the emergency TRO on Apr. 25, and Judge Terry Doughty released a memorandum order that day to set a hearing for May 16, 2025, due to the Court\u2019s belief that V.M.L., her mother, and her sister were already deported.\nUpdate 1: On May 8, the parties submitted a joint stipulation of dismissal.2025-04-25\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Immigration policy \u2014 punishment of sanctuary cities and states (Executive Order 14159) (DOJ \u201cSanctuary Jurisdiction Directives\u201d (Feb. 5, 2025))Organized Communities Against Deportations et al v.

The lawsuit seeks to block the implementation of this guidance on the basis that it violates the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. \nCase Summary: Acting Attorney General Benjamine Huffman issued policy guidance that, among other immigration-related policies, instructs the Civil Division of the Department of Justice \u201cto identify state and local laws, policies, and activities that are inconsistent with Executive Branch immigration initiatives and, where appropriate, to take legal action to challenge such laws.\u201d The plaintiffs, Chicago-based immigrant-advocacy organizations, allege that the guidance, and subsequent raids \u201cspecifically for the purpose of ending the Plaintiffs\u2019 Sanctuary City advocacy and movement building,\u201d violate the Administrative Procedure Act and the First Amendment. The lawsuit seeks an injunction against the Department of Justice\u2019s guidance.\nUpdate 1: On Jan. 29, Plaintiffs requested the Court\u2019s permission to withdraw their pending motions for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction.

The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration should be blocked from implementing the EO because both the EO and the DOJ memo violate multiple Constitutional provisions and the Administrative Procedure Act. The court has since temporarily blocked the government\u2019s action.\nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s executive order directed the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities, which the Department of Justice implemented through a Feb. 5, 2025 \u201cSanctuary Jurisdiction Directives\u201d memorandum. The district court granted a preliminary injunction to block the government from freezing and withholding federal funds and later clarified that this block is applicable to Executive Orders (EOs) and government actions that postdate the block. The plaintiffs include various cities and counties. They sued on the grounds that the executive order and DOJ memo violate the Tenth Amendment\u2019s reservation of unenumerated power to the states, separation of powers, the spending clause, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The lawsuit seeks a declaration that the executive order is unconstitutional and a permanent injunction on any effort to enforce the provisions withholding funding.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 17, Plaintiffs filed a motion requesting a preliminary injunction.

Defendants filed their opposition to this motion on May 7, urging the court to deny Plaintiffs\u2019 new motion because EO 14287 falls outside of the four corners of the complaint.\nUpdate 6: On May 9, Judge Orrick clarified that Defendants could not use EO 14287 or other Government action that postdates the preliminary injunction as a workaround to the preliminary injunction order. The preliminary injunction order should be read to apply to \u201cany Executive Order or agency directive that purports to attempt to cut off federal funding from States or localities that meet the Government\u2019s definition of \u2018Sanctuary\u2019 jurisdiction\u201d in the \u201cunconstitutional manner threatened by [EOs 14159 and 14218].\u201d2025-05-09\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Immigration policy \u2014 punishment of sanctuary cities and states (Executive Order 14159) (DOJ \u201cSanctuary Jurisdiction Directives\u201d (Feb. 5, 2025))City of Chelsea v.

The Plaintiffs represent several religious organizations from across the United States which believe their purposes and missions are being thwarted by the policy change, as spaces of religious sanctity are no longer safe from federal immigration enforcement.

The plaintiff, Make the Road New York (MRNY), argues the rule violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, the INA, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by subjecting individuals to summary deportation without adequate procedural safeguards. The suit claims the rule is arbitrary, exceeds statutory authority, and disregards legal and constitutional protections against wrongful removal\u200b.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 22, Plaintiff amended the complaint to include Mary and her son John as plaintiffs who were removed to Mexico following their expedited removal orders under the new rule expanding expedited removal. Plaintiffs allege the rule illegally authorizes expedited removal for noncitizens who filed affirmative applications for asylum as well.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 18, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. Defendants state that the legality of the expedited removal statute has long standing precedent and allege Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are time-barred and outside the zone of interests.\nUpdate 3: On May 12, Plaintiffs filed a response to the motion to dismiss, refuting the Defendants\u2019 arguments and further arguing that the allegations supporting the Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint are plausible.2025-05-12\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Immigration Policy \u2013 Discontinuation of CBP One app (Executive Order 14165)Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center et al v.

No. 71 Complaint\nMotion for TRO (underlying case filed June 12, 2024)2025-01-23Overview: Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center (a non-profit organization based in Texas) and the ACLU initially sued the Biden administration to challenge a rule limiting asylum access, including in relation to the CBP One app that was used to schedule appointments to request asylum. After the Trump administration's directive to shut down the CBP One app, Plaintiffs filed a motion to temporarily block this action; the court denied the motion on February 6, 2025.\nCase Summary: The Trump administration executive order directs the Department of Homeland Security to cease operation of the CBP One app, which was created by the Biden administration to enable asylum seekers to schedule appointments to request asylum. The Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and the ACLU had previously sued to challenge a Biden administration rule that limited asylum access to those presenting at a port of entry or falling under another narrow exception. In response, the government argued that the CBP One app remained as a pathway by which asylum-seekers could request appointments. In light of the discontinuation of the CBP One app, Las Americas, et al, filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and requested an immediate status conference and leave to file supplemental briefings to address the government\u2019s position.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 6, the court denied the motion for a temporary restraining order on the basis that the court lacked authority to order the government to parole noncitizens into the United States, determining that this power is wielded exclusively at the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland Security.\nUpdate 2: On February 26, the Court issued a ruling denying Texas\u2019s motion to intervene and motion for summary judgment, but granted Texas leave to file a brief as amicus curiae.The Court further denied the Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. \nUpdate 3: On May 9, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment as well as granting in part and denying in part Defendants\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment. In so doing, the Court ordered that the Final Rule\u2019s limitation on asylum eligibility be vacated and set aside, that the Final Rule\u2019s manifestation of fear requirements be vacated and set aside, that the four-hour consultation window in the Guidance be vacated and set aside, that the provisions of the Final Rule not mentioned in the Order remain in effect and that the individual Plaintiffs\u2019 removal orders and negative credible fear determinations be vacated.2025-05-09\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Access of Lawyers to Immigrants in Detention (Executive Order 14159)Amica Center for Immigrant Rights et al. v. U.S. Department of Justice (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00298Complaint2025-01-31Overview: Nine immigrant advocacy organizations filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice, challenging the stop-work order that halted funding for legal resource programs for unrepresented immigrants facing deportation. The lawsuit seeks to temporarily block the order on the basis that it violates the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. The district court ruled against the plaintiffs, but they have appealed that decision.\nCase Summary: In 2024, Congress appropriated funds for two immigration programs, the Legal Orientation Program (LOP) and Immigration Court Helpdesk (ICH). On Jan. 22, 2025, the Department of Justice Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) issued a stop-work order that halted funding for four programs providing legal resources to unrepresented people facing deportation. The EOIR action was taken purportedly to \u201caudit\u201d the programs pursuant to the Trump administration executive order. Nine advocacy and immigrant legal services organizations sued, arguing that terminating funding for the programs is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA); violates the Appropriations Clause in the case of the LOP and ICH; and violates the First Amendment by denying the plaintiffs access to courthouses and immigration detention centers. The suit seeks a temporary restraining order  and preliminary injunction and to enjoin the government from stopping the programs, refusing to spend appropriated funds, preventing the plaintiffs from accessing immigration courts houses and detention centers, and removing materials and posters the plaintiffs have posted in those locations.\nUpdate 1: Immediately after filing their complaint, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction, along with a supporting memorandum of law, on Jan. 31. Plaintiffs requested that the court order Defendants to block the enforcement of Executive Order (EO) 14159.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 5, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction, asserting that Plaintiffs do not qualify for extraordinary relief and that their claims fail on the merits. Plaintiffs replied to this opposition on Mar. 13.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 14, Plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for a TRO and supporting memorandum. Defendants responded in opposition to the renewed motion the next day, asserting that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims belong in the Court of Federal Claims.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 18, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which included three new allegations: (1) APA Violation of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA); (2) violation of the separation of powers; and (3) an ultra vires violation. \nUpdate 5: On Apr. 24, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. Defendants included a supporting memorandum for their motion.\nUpdate 6: On May 2, Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and requested preliminary injunctive relief.\nUpdate 7: On May 9, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to the Motion to Dismiss, refuting Defendants\u2019 claims and arguing that the Court does have jurisdiction, that the Programs\u2019 termination is reviewable and that all of the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are viable. \nUpdate 8: Also on May 9, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment and opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgement and request for preliminary injunctive relief. They argue that the court lacks jurisdiction, that the APA claims fail for independent threshold reasons, and that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment. Further, they argue that any preliminary relief is unwarranted and if granted should be limited in scope. \nUpdate 9: On May 12, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and a motion for preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 10: On May 23, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that included additional facts, amended one claim for relief, and added three more, including a violation of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 and a separation of powers violation for usurping legislative function.\nUpdate 11: On July 6, 2025, the Court denied the Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment and a preliminary injunction and granted the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgement with respect to (1) the Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional and non-statutory claims arising from the in-sourcing of LOP and LOPC, and (2) the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims arising from the termination of ICH, FGLOP, and CCI. Further, the Court dismissed the remainder of the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. \nUpdate 12: On July 14, the Plaintiffs appealed to the DC Circuit.2025-07-14\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Access of Lawyers to Immigrants in Detention (Executive Order 14159)C.M. v.

Noem (N.D. Cal.)\n\nNinth Cir. Case No. 25-2120\n\nCase No. 25-cv-01766Complaint2025-02-19Overview: The National TPS Alliance (an organization representing individuals with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in the U.S.) and individuals from Venezuela who have TPS challenged the Trump administration's decision to terminate TPS for Venezuelans in the U.S., arguing that the action was unlawful and motivated by racial bias. On March 31, Judge Edward Chen ordered the Trump administration to postpone the termination of temporary protected status for Venezuelan nationals. The Trump administration appealed the order the following day, and the Appellate Court later rejected the appeal. The administration appealed to the Supreme Court on May 1, and, on May 19, the Supreme Court granted a temporary block of the district court's order while the appeals proceed.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 17, 2025, near the end of President Joe Biden\u2019s term, DHS Secretary Mayorkas extended the designation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans living in the United States. On Jan. 28, President Trump\u2019s newly-confirmed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem vacated that extension, and days later she terminated TPS for Venezuelans who had first registered for protected status in 2023.\nPlaintiffs allege that DHS lacks authority to \u201cvacate\u201d a prior TPS extension, but even if it did have such authority, the Secretary\u2019s justifications are \u201carbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, pretextual, and inexplicably deviate from past practice in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\u201d Citing Secretary Noem\u2019s references to Venezuelan TPS holders as \u201cdirtbags,\u201d Plaintiffs also allege that the Secretary\u2019s actions were motivated at least partly by racial animus, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs request that the court declare unlawful and set aside DHS\u2019s vacatur and termination orders and reinstate the prior TPS extension.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 20, the Plaintiffs filed a motion to postpone the effective date of DHS\u2019s vacatur and termination orders. The Plaintiffs argued they are likely to succeed on the merits because Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the authority to vacate the extension, the vacatur was arbitrary and capricious, and the government was motivated by racial animus. They also argued that they face a risk of irreparable harm and that, on balance, the Plaintiffs and the public interest would be more harmed by the absence of a stay than the Defendants would be by the imposition of one. \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 3, the Defendants filed a reply to the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to postpone the effective date. The Defendants argued that the court lacks jurisdiction to review Secretary Noem\u2019s actions or to provide the Plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief. They also argue that even if the court has jurisdiction, the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims fail on the merits.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 7, the Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion to postpone the effective date of DHS\u2019s orders. \nUpdate 4: On Mar. 20, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding claims against Secretary Noem\u2019s decision to reduce the 2024 TPS extension for Haiti to 12 months, and asking the court to declare that the 18-month TPS extension remains in effect. Additionally, the court held a hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 motion to postpone the effective date of the Venezuela TPS claim on March 24 and a decision is forthcoming.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 31, Judge Edward Chen granted plaintiffs motion (in a 78-page court order) to postpone the termination of temporary protected status for Venezuelan nationals. \nUpdate 6: On Apr. 1, Defendants appealed Judge Chen\u2019s Mar. 31 order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 18, the Ninth Circuit denied the Defendants\u2019 motion for a stay.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 29, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, alleging that the District Court lacks jurisdiction over the entire action on a variety of grounds. Further, the Motion to Dismiss argues that the Secretary\u2019s actions did not violate the APA, being neither arbitrary nor capricious, and that the Plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claims should fail as a matter of law. \nUpdate 9: On May 1, the Defendants appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the district court's order.\nUpdate 10: On May 19 the Supreme Court granted the stay for the government.\nUpdate 11: On May 30, the district court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to prevent the Defendants\u2019 from invalidating work permits and other documents to a subset of the Venezuelan plaintiffs but narrowed the scope of the TPS holders who are entitled to relief. The court wrote, \u201cThe Court also notes that the relief here would not extend to all Venezuelan TPS holders but rather a discrete subset \u2013 somewhere in the neighborhood of 5,000 individuals in the government\u2019s estimation.\u201d\nUpdate 12: On June 4, the Plaintiffs filed a notice of Defedants\u2019 Non-Compliance with court orders regarding discovery, specifically ongoing failure to file required declarations in a timely manner. On June 5, the Court ordered that the Defendants have failed to comply with prior court orders. The Court ordered the government to immediately provide any and all declarations previously ordered by the end of the day.\nUpdate 13: On July 8, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to further update the complaint in light of changes in administration policy since the complaint was last amended. On July 9, case 25-cv-05687-TLT was referred to Judge Chen to determine the relationship between the cases.2025-07-08\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: DHS Revocation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS)Casa, Inc. and Make the Road New York v.

Noem (D. Mass.) \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-10495Complaint2025-02-28Overview: A group of noncitizens applying for immigration status in the United States (along with related interest groups) have filed a class action lawsuit alleging that President Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Order ending certain immigration programs and benefits is unlawful. This group has requested that the court block the EO on the basis that it violates federal law and the Constitution\u2019s Due Process Clause.\nCase Summary: The Trump administration executive order directs the Department of Homeland Security to terminate all categorical parole programs contrary to the president\u2019s executive orders. In effect, this ended the following programs: Uniting for Ukraine (U4U), Parole Processes for Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV), and Operation Allies Welcome (OAW). Subsequently, on Feb. 14, Acting Deputy Director of USCIS Andrew Davidson issued a memorandum (not yet made public) to various USCIS directorates and program officers directing them not to adjudicate immigration benefit requests filed by noncitizens who are or were paroled into the United States under: U4U; CHNV; family reunification parole processes created in 2023 for nationals of Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras; a family reunification parole processes for Haitians that was created in 2014 and expanded in 2023; and a family reunification parole process for Cubans that was created in 2007 and expanded in 2023.\nPlaintiffs in this class action contend that both Executive Order 14165 and the Davidson memo violate the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. As such, Plaintiffs request an injunction in order to restore the status quo ante.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 17, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to include: additional plaintiffs; family members of affected individuals as part of the class; additional immigration parole programs; and a request that the court set aside DHS\u2019 suspension of the adjudication of requests for parole, re-parole, and other immigration benefits. Plaintiffs also filed a motion on Mar. 17 requesting a preliminary injunction and administrative stay against DHS\u2019 indefinite moratorium on adjudicating immigration benefit applications, on the basis that Plaintiffs would succeed on their Administrative Procedure Act and Immigration and Nationality Act claims and that Plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury.  \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 21, DHS filed an opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification for the class action on the same day, defining the class as all individuals with pending applications to sponsor someone for humanitarian parole processes, as well as all individuals, who have received humanitarian parole through already established processes, with pending applications for additional immigration benefit. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 27, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended complaint to include: additional plaintiffs; additional factual allegations related to DHS\u2019 Mar. 25 Federal Register Notice that terminates the parole programs for Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, and sets a termination date of the temporary parole period of individuals under these parole programs to April 24, 2025; and an additional claim for relief arguing that the Mar. 25 Federal Register Notice violates the Administrative Procedure Act because Plaintiffs did not receive written notice of termination of parole. On Mar. 27, Plaintiffs also filed an emergency motion for preliminary injunction and administrative stay to block DHS\u2019 early termination of the temporary parole period, as stated in the Mar. 25 Federal Register Notice. Plaintiffs argue that the termination violates the Administrative Procedure Act and request a preliminary injunction and a stay to block DHS from implementing or enforcing the termination of parole processes, on the grounds that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their Administrative Procedure Act claim and that they will suffer irreparable injury. \nUpdate 4: On Apr. 14, Judge Indira Talwani issued an order granting class certification and another order granting a stay temporarily blocking the government\u2019s action.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 18, Defendants filed a notice that they were appealing the court\u2019s order staying parole terminations to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. \nUpdate 6: On May 5, the First Circuit denied Defendants\u2019 petition for a stay.\nUpdate 7: On May 8, the Defendants\u2019 petitioned the Supreme Court for an emergency stay.\nUpdate 8: On May 30, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to temporarily end the humanitarian parole program that granted provisional legal status to over 530,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV), enabling them to live and work in the U.S. while their immigration cases were pending. This decision overrules the Massachusetts District Court\u2019s order that had previously blocked the administration\u2019s effort.2025-05-30\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Proclamation Prohibiting Non-Citizens from Invoking Asylum Provisions\u201d (Proclamation 10888)Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services v. Noem (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 25-5243\nD.D.C. No. 1:25-cv-00306Complaint2025-02-03Overview: Three nonprofit organizations challenged a proclamation by President Donald Trump that disallows immigrants from remaining in the U.S. while pursuing asylum claims. The lawsuit argues that the proclamation  violates multiple laws and Constitutional provisions. After the Trump administration agreed not to use the proclamation to deport individual asylum-seekers during the litigation, a federal judge denied the emergency motion to pause the implementation of the proclamation.  Both parties have requested that the court enter a judgment for this case.\nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s proclamation bars immigrants who arrive after the date of the proclamation from invoking provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that would permit them to remain in the United States while pursuing asylum claims. The plaintiffs, three nonprofit organizations in Texas and Arizona providing legal services and assistance to undocumented individuals or asylum seekers, argue that the order violates the following statutory and constitutional provisions:\n1. the Asylum Statute in the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1) (by barring noncitizens from applying for asylum in direct contradiction to congressional protections);\n2. the Withholding of Removal Statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (by preventing noncitizens from seeking protection from persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion);\n3. the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act (FARRA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231, and the Convention Against Torture (CAT) (by depriving noncitizens of a meaningful opportunity to present CAT claims and shielding them from potential torture);\n4. the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232(a)(5)(D) (by denying unaccompanied children from non-contiguous countries their statutory right to regular removal proceedings);\n5. the INA\u2019s procedural protections for removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101, 1229a, 1225(b) (by overriding mandated removal proceedings and eliminating procedural protections, including credible fear screenings);\n6. the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (by implementing policies that are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law) and \u00a7 706(2)(D) (by failing to follow the required rulemaking process before enacting sweeping changes to statutory protections); and \n7. the constitutional separation of powers (by exceeding presidential authority and unlawfully overriding congressionally enacted immigration protections).\nThe Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the proclamation is unlawful and an injunction stopping its implementation.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 19, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to stay removal of individual plaintiff non-citizens who are currently detained by the Defendants and could be imminently deported under the proclamation. On Feb. 20, Judge Moss issued an administrative stay in the case until 12 pm on Feb. 24 to allow the government time to gather information to respond, and time for expedited briefing. The court further ordered the Defendants to respond to Plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion for a stay of removal by Feb. 21.  \nUpdate 2: On Feb. 22, Judge Moss denied as moot the emergency motion to stay removal of individual asylum-seekers because the government agreed not to use President Trump\u2019s January 2025 border proclamation to remove them during the litigation. The court ordered that the government must provide at least seven days\u2019 notice before removing any of the plaintiffs during the case and vacated the scheduled hearing.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 24, the Trump administration filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting, among other things, that plaintiffs lack standing, that presidential decisions are not reviewable under the APA, and that the \u201c[t]he determination that the United States is facing an invasion is an unreviewable political question.\u201d\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 7, Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment. Their proposed order requests a permanent injunction to prevent the Trump Administration from enforcing the proclamation.\nOn that same day, Plaintiffs filed an opposition to the Trump Administration\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 21, the Trump Administration filed a reply in support of its Mar. 24 motion for summary judgment, arguing that the President has broad discretion under INA Article II to suspend entry of classes of aliens even if Plaintiffs can assert their claims.\nUpdate 6: On July 2, Judge Moss granted summary judgment in a class action lawsuit against the administration, vacating Proclamation 10888 and its related guidelines, which barred immigrants without a visa from applying for asylum or withholding removal. The court found that neither the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) nor the Constitution allows the administration to replace relevant regulations \u201cwith an extra-statutory, extra-regulatory regime\u201d to deprive an individual of the opportunity to seek asylum or withhold removal. 2025-07-02\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Proclamation Prohibiting Non-Citizens from Invoking Asylum Provisions\u201d (Proclamation 10888)Al Otro Lado v.

Plaintiffs seek to block implementation of the EO on the basis that it is unlawful and violates federal immigration law, administrative procedure requirements, and that it goes beyond the authority of the President. \nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 10888 which bars immigrants who arrive after the date of the EO from invoking provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) that would permit them to remain in the United States while pursuing asylum claims. Plaintiffs,  two immigration nonprofits based in California, Al Otro Lado and Haitian Bridge Alliance, filed a class action suit on June 11, 2025 against Defendants Trump, Secretary Noem, Secretary Rubio, Attorney General Bondi, and Commissioner Pete Flores and Assistant Commissioner Diane Sabatino of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Plaintiffs claim that the EO violates 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by unlawfully shutting down access to asylum at ports of entry (POE) along the US-Mexico border as of the date of the EO. Plaintiffs also claim that the EO violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it is unlawful, arbitrary & capricious, and does not observe required procedure. Plaintiffs also claim that the EO and its implementation are ultra vires, as beyond the scope of authority.

No. 43\n\nCASE CLOSEDComplaint2025-02-09Overview: Three Venezuelan men sued the U.S. government to temporarily block their transfer to Guant\u00e1namo Bay on the basis that they were already in proceedings contesting their detention. A federal judge granted the temporary restraining order. Subsequently, the three men were deported to Venezuela and the case was dismissed.\nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s Presidential Memorandum orders the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to prepare the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to function at full capacity as a detention center for undocumented migrants. Three Venezuelan men, already part of an existing habeas lawsuit from September 2024 in the District Court of New Mexico, sought to block the administration from transferring them to the Guantanamo facility. Based on their similarities to those previously relocated, the men anticipated being moved as well. The challenge is specific to three specific individuals, under the All Writs Act to preserve the ongoing jurisdiction of the court, and does not seek to block other transfers.\nOn Feb. 9, Chief District Judge Kenneth J. Gonzales granted a temporary restraining order, barring the U.S. government from transferring the three men.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 13, Judge Gonzales issued a 1-page Memorandum Opinion and Order noting that the Defendants had filed a Notice that all three petitioners were removed to Venezuela on Feb. 10; and vacated the upcoming status conference.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 14, the docket reflected a Notice of voluntary dismissal of the case by the three petitioners.2025-02-14\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Migrant Transfers to Guantanamo (Presidential Memorandum)Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center v. Noem (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00418  Complaint2025-02-12Overview: A coalition of immigrant advocacy groups, on behalf of families of four Venezuelan nationals believed to have been transferred to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's order to transfer undocumented migrants to Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Plaintiffs subsequently amended their complaint to remove the advocacy groups and families from the case but to designate it a class action suit on behalf of all similarly situated detainees held at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Plaintiffs argue that the U.S. government\u2019s actions violate the Constitution and immigration law and ask the court to allow detainees to have access to lawyers and to have their locations disclosed. \nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s Presidential Memorandum orders the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to prepare the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guant\u00e1namo Bay to function at full capacity as a detention center for undocumented migrants. Plaintiffs are suing on behalf of the families of four Venezuelan nationals who are believed to have been transferred to Guant\u00e1namo. Plaintiffs allege the government\u2019s action violates habeas corpus rights, Fifth Amendment Due Process rights, and the Immigration and Naturalization Act\u2019s guarantee of the right to counsel. Plaintiffs further allege that the government\u2019s alleged restriction of information in and out of Guant\u00e1namo violates both the plaintiffs\u2019 and the detainees\u2019 First Amendment rights. They seek court orders declaring that the government\u2019s actions violate those rights, permitting access to lawyers, requiring the government to identify the location of detainees held at Guant\u00e1namo, requiring the government to provide 72-hours notice prior to any transfer to a foreign jurisdiction, and requiring the government to provide 72-hours notice prior to any transfer of additional noncitizens to Guant\u00e1namo.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 20, the government filed a notice that DHS had removed the immigration detainees from Guant\u00e1namo, which the government asserted \u201celiminates any need for temporary injunctive relief.\u201d Just prior, it filed its Opposition to the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order arguing, among other things, that the Plaintiffs (family members of individuals who had been held at Guant\u00e1namo, and advocacy organizations) lacked standing because they were not themselves detained, that the District Court lacked statutory authority to require the government to provide notice before transferring individuals into or out of Guant\u00e1namo, and denying the validity of Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional claims. \nUpdate 2: On Feb. 21, Plaintiffs filed a Reply reasserting their request for a TRO to prevent the government from sending more detainees to Guant\u00e1namo.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 24, Plaintiffs filed a Reply explaining that in spite of the administration\u2019s Feb. 20 notice that all immigrant detainees had been transferred off Guant\u00e1namo and the TRO was moot, they had learned via social media that another group of immigrants was being sent to Guant\u00e1namo. The Reply adds further factual allegations and legal arguments that immigrant detainees are prevented from having real meaningful access to legal representation. These include that (1) the government and guards at the detention camp do not allow detainees to make phone calls, including by saying \u201cthis is a terrorist prison and there is no capacity to make calls\u201d and by limiting available phones and times such that most people cannot use them; (2) unrepresented detainees transferred to Guantanamo do not have access to a legal directory, know your rights briefings, or practical means to meet counsel; and (3) retained counsel face numerous obstacles to representing their clients, including that only five detainees can make phone calls each day, there are no means for attorneys to initiate contact with their clients, and there is no way to transfer or sign paperwork other than the government's announced policy to \u201cgenerally follow the procedures used in the habeas litigation involving law of war detainees,\u201d and to transfer mail to detainees from Washington, D.C. on a weekly basis. \nPlaintiffs argue that these restrictions violate detainees\u2019 First and Fifth Amendment rights, as well as their statutory right to counsel under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as well as the plaintiff advocacy organizations\u2019 First Amendment rights. \nUpdate 4: On March 19, the Defendants submitted a notice agreeing to notification before any plaintiffs would be transferred to Guantanamo.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 26, Plaintiffs amended their complaint and removed the advocacy groups and families from the case, designating it a class action suit and limiting it to two named detainees and \u201call immigration detainees originally apprehended in the United States and detained at U.S. immigration detention facilities, and who are, or will be held at Naval Station Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\u201d Among their edits include the removal of three of their original five claims for relief. The remaining two claims for relief include violations of the First Amendment rights of immigrant detainees and Fifth Amendment Due Process rights.2025-04-26\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Migrant Transfers to Guantanamo (Presidential Memorandum)Espinoza Escalona v.

These noncitizens argue that the U.S. government\u2019s actions violate the Constitution and immigration law and ask the court to prevent them and other noncitizens from being transferred to Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and if they are transferred, to return them to immigration facilities in the U.S. The government subsequently removed the plaintiffs from the United States rendering their complaint moot.\nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s Presidential Memorandum orders the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to prepare the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guant\u00e1namo Bay to function at full capacity as a detention center for undocumented migrants. Plaintiffs, ten noncitizens in immigration custody in the United States, allege they will be imminently transferred to facilities at Guant\u00e1namo. They filed suit, arguing that under the Immigration and Nationality Act, Guant\u00e1namo is in Cuba, and therefore transfer would constitute (1) unlawful removal; and (2) unlawful detention. They also argue removal would be (3) an arbitrary and capricious abuse of discretion under the Administrative Procedure Act; (4) a violation of Fifth Amendment Due Process; and (5) a violation of the right to habeas corpus. They seek a declaratory judgment that transfer to and detention in Guant\u00e1namo is unlawful and unconstitutional; that the memorandum be vacated; a grant of a writ of habeas corpus to enjoin defendants from transferring plaintiffs to Guant\u00e1namo, or if they have been transferred and detained, return to facilities in the United States; and an injunction on future transfers.\nThe same day, Plaintiffs also filed an emergency motion to stay transfer of plaintiffs.\nUpdate 1: On March 19, the Defendants submitted a notice agreeing to notification before any plaintiffs would be transferred to Guantanamo.\nUpdate 2: On May 22, the plaintiffs submitted a Notice of voluntary dismissal stating that the government has removed them and their claims are thus rendered moot.\n2025-05-22\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Migrant Transfers to Guantanamo (Presidential Memorandum)Luna Gutierrez v.

The group argues that the detainment policy violates immigration law as well as the Constitution.\nCase Summary: On January 29, 2025 President Donald Trump issued a  Presidential Memorandum ordering the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to prepare the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guant\u00e1namo Bay to function at full capacity as a detention center for undocumented migrants. Plaintiffs, who represent a class of noncitizens who are or will be held in civil detention at Guant\u00e1namo under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), filed suit on June 4, 2025, arguing that the federal government does not have the statutory authority to detain noncitizens awaiting immigration proceedings at Guant\u00e1namo, that the detention violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it is arbitrary and capricious, that the detention is a violation of the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, and that immigration detainees have the right to habeas corpus to challenge the legality of their transfer and detention. Plaintiffs are requesting that the court declare that such detention on Guant\u00e1namo violates the INA, APA, and Fifth Amendment, and to block Defendants from detaining Plaintiffs or any future potential detainees at Guant\u00e1namo.  2025-06-04\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (Executive Order No. 14163) and Refugee Funding Suspension (Dept of State Notice) Pacito v. Trump (W.D. Wash)\n\nCase No. 2:25-cv-00255Complaint2025-02-10Overview: Ten plaintiffs, including refugees, U.S. citizens, and resettlement organizations, challenged President Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Order (\u201cEO\u201d) and the State Department\u2019s January 24, 2025 notice that indefinitely suspend refugee admissions and cut federal funding for resettlement programs. The lawsuit argues that these actions violate the Refugee Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and Constitutional due process rights. A federal judge has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction barring implementation of the EO and the notice. The Trump administration has challenged the preliminary injunction on appeal to the Ninth Circuit, who granted in part and denied in part the Trump Administration\u2019s challenge and later clarified the scope of the preliminary injunction.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order indefinitely suspending refugee admissions and processing. The State Department issued a Jan. 24 notice suspending federal funding for resettlement programs. Ten plaintiffs \u2014 individual refugees, U.S. citizens, and resettlement organizations (HIAS, Church World Service, and Lutheran Community Services Northwest) \u2014 filed a proposed class action seeking injunctions to block implementation of the orders, declaratory judgments that the actions are unlawful, maintenance of refugee processing and resettlement services consistent with the status quo, and confirmation of compliance with such remedies if granted. The lawsuit alleges that the orders have left approved refugees stranded internationally, denied recent arrivals statutorily-mandated support services, and forced layoffs at resettlement institutions. \nThe complaint asserts that the executive orders violate the Refugee Act\u2019s comprehensive statutory scheme for refugee policy, are arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act for circumventing notice-and-comment requirements and failing to establish a reasoned basis for the change in policy, and breach agency regulations at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 207.7 governing the Follow-to-Join process in violation of the Accardi doctrine requiring government officials to follow the agency\u2019s own rules and procedures. The lawsuit further argues that the orders violate the Fifth Amendment due process rights of U.S. citizens petitioning for family reunification, and violate fundamental separation of powers principles by attempting to redistribute or withhold congressionally appropriated funds to achieve policy objectives.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 25, Judge Jamal Whitehead, ruling from the bench, issued a preliminary injunction barring implementation of the executive order. \nUpdate 2: On Feb. 28, Judge Whitehead issued a written opinion granting the nationwide preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 3, the government submitted a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 5, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. Citing continued steps by the administration to dismantle resettlement programs after Judge Whitehead\u2019s preliminary injunction, including the termination of cooperative agreements implementing the resettlement programs, the amended complaint also requests a TRO and preliminary injunction against implementation of the EO. The plaintiffs also submitted a motion for a preliminary injunction on the basis of this amended complaint.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 8, the Trump administration filed an emergency motion to stay the district court proceedings with the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs filed their response to this emergency motion with the Ninth Circuit on Mar. 14.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 24, the court granted a second preliminary injunction on the basis of Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 25, the Trump administration filed a notice that it was appealing the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit.\nOn that same day, the Ninth Circuit granted in part and denied in part the emergency motion to stay the preliminary injunction issued by Judge Whitehead on Feb. 28. The Ninth Circuit denied the motion to the extent it applies to individuals who were conditionally approved for refugee status before Jan. 20, 2025, but otherwise granted the motion to stay.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 3, Plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the first preliminary injunction due to Defendants\u2019 noncompliance with the preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion also included an emergency motion for a show cause hearing.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 8, the Defendants filed a reply to Plaintiffs\u2019 Apr. 3 motion to enforce the preliminary injunction, arguing Plaintiffs\u2019 read of the Ninth Circuit\u2019s stay order is too narrow. The Trump administration requested the court hold Plaintiffs\u2019 motion in abeyance pending the Ninth Circuit\u2019s ruling on their pending appeals.\nUpdate 10: On Apr. 9, Plaintiffs filed a response in further support of their motion to enforce the preliminary injunction. On Apr. 11, Judge Whitehead granted this motion in part and ordered Defendants to immediately cease the suspension of and resume refugee processing and resettlement support for individuals conditionally approved for refugee status by USCIS before Jan. 20, 2025. This order also requires Defendants to cease the implementation of any suspension of funding to USRAP partner agencies.\nUpdate 11: On Apr. 21, the Ninth Circuit issued a notice to clarify its Mar. 25 order, which granted in part and denied in part Defendants\u2019 motion for an emergency stay of Judge Whitehead\u2019s preliminary injunction. The Ninth Circuit noted that the stay request is denied to the extent that Judge Whitehead\u2019s preliminary injunction orders applies to individuals who, before January 20, 2025, (1) had approved refugee applications authorizing them to be conditionally admitted as a refugee to the U.S.; (2) were cleared by USCIS for travel to the United States; and (3) had arranged and confirmable travel plans to the United States. \nUpdate 12: On Apr. 28, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the first supplemental complaint, alleging a variety of both substantive and procedural shortcomings in the Plaintiffs\u2019 first supplemental complaint.\nUpdate 13:  On July 14, Judge Whitehead issued an injunction framework order, clarifying the scope and process of his previous injunction and establishing a framework for reviewing refugee cases. The court is requiring the administration to provide a survey and notice to identify individuals eligible for review. The court also designated specific groups for whom the burden of proof shifts to the administration, including \u201c160 refugees with imminent travel,\u201d \u201c[u]naccompanied minor children\u201d, and \u201cAfghan refugees at Camp As Sayliyah.\u201d Refugees approved for expedited processing due to medical or protection concerns are not included in this group. Previously, on April 21, the Ninth Circuit limited and clarified Judge Whitehead\u2019s injunction.2025-07-15\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Suspension of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (Executive Order No. 14163) and Refugee Funding Suspension (Dept of State Notice) United States Conference of Catholic Bishops v. Department of State et al. (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00465Complaint2025-02-18Overview: The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (\u201cUSCCB\u201d), whose members are the active Cardinals, Archbishops, and Bishops of the Catholic Church in the U.S. and which provides refugee-resettlement services, sued the Trump administration over its suspension of refugee admissions and funding for resettlement programs. USCCB argues the Trump administration\u2019s actions are illegal under the Administrative Procedure Act and seeks to prohibit the U.S. government from implementing the suspension. A federal judge refused to immediately stop the U.S. government\u2019s actions but agreed to speed up the process for deciding whether to block them.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order indefinitely suspending refugee admissions and processing. The State Department issued a Jan. 24 notice suspending federal funding for resettlement programs. Plaintiff, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), is part of a public-private partnership with the federal government through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, and was providing transitionary resettlement services to more than 6,700 refugees when the State Department suspended funding. USCCB brought suit, arguing the government policy suspending funds for the Refugee Admissions Program is unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act because it (1) violates the Immigration and Naturalization Act, the Refugee Act of 1980, and the Impoundment Control Act; (2) is an arbitrary and capricious abuse of discretion; and (3) is a substantive role promulgated without required notice-and-comment rulemaking. They seek a declaratory judgment that the suspension is unlawful, and temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctions prohibiting the government from implementing the suspension and requiring the government to make reimbursements pursuant to the terms of its cooperative agreements.\nUpdate 1: On Feb 20, 2025, Judge Trevor N. McFadden denied the request for a temporary restraining order, but ordered an expedited briefing schedule for the preliminary injunction motion.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 24, Plaintiffs filed a supplemental memorandum in support of the motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 3, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, an amended motion for a preliminary injunction, and a memorandum in support of that motion; and Judge McFadden ruled that the prior motions for a preliminary injunction are moot in light of the new motion. The amended complaint and the amended motion for a preliminary injunction are in response to new developments in the case, e.g., on Feb. 27, the State Department terminated the cooperative agreements with USCCB for refugee resettlement. This termination changed the nature of the dispute from a suspension of funding to a complete cancellation of the contracts.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 5, the government filed in opposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction and the following day, on Mar. 6, the plaintiffs filed a reply.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 11, Judge McFadden denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an emergency preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 12, Plaintiffs submitted a notice of appeal to the DC Circuit.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 21, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and supporting memorandum, claiming that the government has not waived sovereign immunity, and the Plaintiff\u2019s claims are moot, lack jurisdiction, and fail to state a claim.\nUpdate 8: On April 24, Plaintiffs filed a motion for the voluntary dismissal of their appeal of the district court\u2019s order denying a preliminary injunction. This motion was granted by the DC Circuit on May 2.\nUpdate 9: On May 12, Plaintiffs filed their opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, stressing that the court\u2019s denial of the preliminary injunction does not preclude Plaintiffs from seeking other forms of equitable relief.\n2025-05-12\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Funding Freeze for Immigration Services  (Executive Order 14159) (Sec. of Homeland Security Memorandum Directive Jan. 28, 2025)Solutions In Hometown Connections v.

They argue that the freeze, implemented in response to an executive order from President Trump, violates the Constitution, immigration law, and administrative procedures. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief to lift the freeze, restore their funding, and prevent further harm to their operations. The court has denied the request to temporarily lift the funding freeze as to most of the impacted organizations.\nCase Summary: Plaintiffs, a group of nonprofit organizations, are challenging actions taken by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to indefinitely freeze grants for nonprofits that help prepare lawful permanent residents for citizenship. They argue that the freeze, implemented by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, via a memorandum directive, in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump, is arbitrary and capricious, and has caused significant harm to their operations, including layoffs and program cuts. They argue that the funding freeze violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the Homeland Security Act, and Due Process under the Fifth Amendment. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief to lift the freeze, restore their funding, and prevent further harm.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 25, Plaintiffs submitted a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 28, Plaintiffs informed the Court that Defendants sent grant termination letters to Plaintiffs the previous day (Mar. 27). These letters noted the termination was effective immediately.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 1, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a TRO and a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 4, Plaintiffs\u2019 submitted a reply in support of their motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 8, Judge Lydia Griggsby denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction for most plaintiffs, but held the motion in abeyance for the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota. In the related opinion issued on Apr. 14, Judge Griggsby found Plaintiffs had not demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of their APA claims due to a lack of jurisdiction.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 25, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On that same day, Plaintiffs also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 7: On May 6, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction motion. On May 12, Plaintiffs replied in support of their preliminary injunction motion.\nUpdate 8: On May 20, Judge Griggsby denied Plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction motion and on May 29 issued a memorandum opinion affirming the denial of the preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 9: Plaintiffs appealed the denial to the Fourth Circuit on June 2.2025-06-02\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Contract Termination for Services to Unaccompanied MinorsCommunity Legal Services in East Palo Alto v.

Numerous immigration nonprofits brought a suit against DOI, HHS, and ORR, to block this cessation of funding. On Apr. 1, the Court issued an order blocking Defendants from withdrawing the services or funds provided by ORR through Apr. 16 and on Apr. 10 agreed to extend the block through Apr. 30. Defendants\u2019 appeal of this decision to the Ninth Circuit was denied. On Apr. 29, the Court granted a preliminary injunction blocking Defendants from withdrawing the services or funds provided by ORR until a final judgment in the matter is issued. Defendants appealed this order on Apr. 30.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 21, 2025, the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) sent a notice (the \u201cCancellation Order\u201d) terminating the funding through which the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) had provided funding for counsel for unaccompanied immigrant children and ordering nonprofits that had received such funding to \u201cimmediately stop work\u201d on their ongoing funded representations for unaccompanied children. Plaintiffs are numerous nonprofits that have received funding from HHS and ORR to provide legal representation and other legal services to unaccompanied children. They have filed suit against Defendants HHS, ORR, and DOI, seeking to enjoin Defendants from ceasing to fund counsel for unaccompanied children. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants\u2019 actions are arbitrary and capricious and violate the Administrative Procedure Act (including conduct not in accordance with law appropriating funds by the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008; and, via the Accardi doctrine, violating the internal 2024 Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule; and \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d conduct).\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 27, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), seeking to block Defendants from ceasing funding for direct legal representation services for unaccompanied immigrant children. On Mar. 31, Defendants filed an opposition to the motion for a TRO. \nUpdate 2: On Apr. 1, the Court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a TRO and enjoined Defendants from cutting off access to congressionally appropriated funding (particularly for direct legal representation services for unaccompanied immigrant children) through Apr. 16.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 4, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to extend the TRO blocking the administration from cutting off congressionally appropriated funding.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 4, Defendants filed a motion to dissolve the TRO in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Department of Education v.

A federal judge has declined the request for a temporary block while the case proceeds, on the basis that no information has yet been shared with DHS.\nCase Summary: Plaintiffs allege that the Trump administration \u201chas begun taking steps to collect information about individuals for potential immigration enforcement\u201d by seeking access to data associated with individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs). The IRS assigns ITINs to individuals who lack social security numbers (i.e., noncitizens) so that such individuals can file tax returns and pay federal income taxes as required by law. Plaintiffs assert that granting immigration enforcement agencies access to the sensitive data of individuals who file using ITINs would \u201cexpose millions of taxpayers to the administration\u2019s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.\u201d \nPlaintiffs claim the government\u2019s actions are ultra vires and violate the Administrative Procedure Act by running afoul of the IRS statute requiring confidentiality of tax return information. \nThey seek declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent Defendants from providing ITIN applications to DHS, ICE, the President, or any others, unless such disclosure is specifically permitted by law.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 14, Plaintiffs filed a motion requesting a temporary restraining order (TRO). \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 17, Defendants filed a response to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a TRO, which included a Motion to Dismiss. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 18, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for a TRO.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 20, following  a hearing the day prior, Judge Dabney Friedrich denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for  a TRO for failure to demonstrate  standing, likelihood of success on the merits, or irreparable harm.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 26, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding new plaintiffs\u2013Somos un Pueblo (\u201cSomos\u201d) and Inclusive Action for the City (\u201cIAC\u201d)\u2013to the complaint; alleging additional harms to Somos\u2019s members, IAC\u2019s business, and arbitrary and capricious action by Treasury Defendants; and requesting additional relief to enjoin DHS Defendants from inspecting information about Plaintiffs\u2019 members without a court order.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 31, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction requesting that the court block Defendants from disclosing, inspecting, or using tax return information for immigration enforcement purposes except as expressly authorized by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 7, Defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss and opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. Defendants argue Plaintiffs lack the jurisdictional requirements to bring a suit and that DHS can legally request tax return information relating to individuals under criminal investigation.\nUpdate 8: On April 10, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction, noting that Defendants\u2019 opposition motion supports Plaintiffs\u2019 position that ICE seeks tax payer data to locate and deport immigrants from the U.S.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 21, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs argue they have standing to bring their claims and have adequately stated a claim for which relief can be granted under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\nUpdate 10: On Apr. 23, Plaintiffs filed a supplemental memorandum in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction in which they proposed a revised preliminary injunction order in light of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) finalized by the Defendants that enables the sharing of taxpayer information.\nUpdate 11: On Apr. 28, Defendants replied to Plaintiffs\u2019 opposition to their motion to dismiss, emphasizing their belief that Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged harms are conjectural and hypothetical.\nUpdate 12: On May 1, Defendants replied to Plaintiffs\u2019 Apr. 23 supplemental memorandum in which they emphasized that Plaintiffs lack standing and requested that the Court grant its motion to dismiss.\nUpdate 13: On May 12, the Court denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for Preliminary Injunction, stating that the Plaintiffs failed to show that they are likely to succeed on their claims.\nUpdate 14: On May 21, the Plaintiffs filed notice that they were appealing the Court\u2019s order denying their Motion for Preliminary Injunction to the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.2025-05-21\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: IRS and Medicaid Data Sharing for Immigration Enforcement Purposes (Executive Order 14165) (Executive Order 14159) (Executive Order 14158)State of California et al v.

Case No. 1:25-cv-01935)Habeas petition2025-03-09Overview: \nCase Summary: On Mar. 8, 2025, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and lawful U.S. permanent resident (a green card holder). Khalil is a recent graduate of Columbia University, where he played a prominent role in organizing pro-Palestinian demonstrations against Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza. (See also Declaration by Khalil\u2019s attorney)\nThe habeas petition alleges, \u201cAt the time this proceeding was initiated, [Khalil] was detained at 26 Federal Plaza in New York, New York.\u201d\nThe government moved Khalil to a detention facility in Louisiana, away from his New York home and his wife, who is eight months pregnant and a U.S. citizen. His legal team filed a habeas corpus petition challenging the legality of his detention and deportation efforts. Khalil\u2019s legal team also moved to compel the government to return him to the Southern District of New York (SDNY).\nOn Mar. 10, SDNY federal judge Jesse Furman temporarily blocked his removal from the United States pending further judicial review, which he extended after an emergency conference hearing on Mar. 12.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 12, the government submitted an declaration from ICE Acting Field Office Director of the NYC office which stated: \"At the time Khalil filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Southern District of New York, he was detained at Elizabeth Detention Facility in Newark, New Jersey.\" The government filed a motion to dismiss or transfer the case to the Western District of Louisiana.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 12, Judge Jesse Furman issued an order lifting restrictions on remote access to electronic files, making all prior and future filings publicly available unless redacted or sealed. The judge also ordered that Khalil be granted at least one privileged attorney-client call on Mar. 12 and at least one such call on Mar. 13.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 14, Petitioner Mahmoud Khalil filed his opposition to the government\u2019s motion to dismiss or transfer the case. The filing argues that, if the court concludes it is not the proper venue for Khalil\u2019s claims, the petition should be transferred to the District of New Jersey (not the Western District of Louisiana, as requested by the government) based on the immediate custodian rule. \nUpdate 4: On Mar. 15, Petitioner Mahmoud Khalil moved for his release. On Mar. 17, Khalil moved for a preliminary injunction: \u201c(1) ordering the release of Mr. Khalil for the pendency of this litigation; (2) enjoining Respondent Rubio\u2019s determination that the INA\u2019s \u2018Foreign Policy Ground\u2019 applies to him for the pendency of this litigation; and (3) enjoining Respondents from enforcing their Policy of arresting, detaining, and removing noncitizens who engage in constitutionally protected expressive activity in the United States in support of Palestinian rights or critical of Israel for the pendency of this litigation.\u201d \nUpdate 5: On Mar. 19, Judge Furman denied the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the Petition, but granted the government\u2019s motion to transfer the case, albeit to the District of New Jersey, not to the Western District of Louisiana. The case is now before Judge Michael Farbiarz.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 1, Judge Michael Farbiarz issued an order and opinion holding the court has habeas jurisdiction over the case, and soliciting the parties\u2019 views on appealability of the order.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 2, the government filed a motion opposing Petitioner Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. The government argues that Petitioner Khalil cannot meet the requirements for a preliminary injunction because they claim that: (1) Petitioner Khalil cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits; (2) Petitioner Khalil has not established irreparable harm, given that he allegedly has multiple other avenues to seek release; and (3) the public interest favors the government, given the allegedly significant public interest in swift enforcement of U.S. immigration laws. In addition, the government requests that a bond be posted should Petitioner Khalil be granted an injunction.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 3, Petitioner Mahmoud Khalil filed a second amended complaint. The amended complaint adds Yolanda Pittman, the warden of the detention facility where Khalil was held in New Jersey on March 9, 2025, as a defendant.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 6, Petitioner Mahmoud Khalil filed a reply in support of his motion for a preliminary injunction. Khalil argues the government is mistaken in its claim that the Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits judicial review of his challenge to his detention and the policy decisions that led to his detention. Khalil also seeks to rebut the government\u2019s arguments that his claims are unlikely to succeed, he has not established irreparable harm, and the balance of the equities leans in favor of the government.\nUpdate 10: On Apr. 29, the District Court reaffirmed its finding of habeas jurisdiction over the case.\nUpdate 11: On May 1, Petitioner Mahmoud Khalil submitted a letter requesting to amend his petition to reflect the transfer of his case to the District of New Jersey, the addition of Yolanda Pittman as a defendant, and the addition of a new charge of removability. On May 8, he submitted an amended complaint.\nUpdate 12: On May 28, Judge Farbiarz ruled in Khalil's favor on the ground that removal for his political activity was unconstitutionally vague, but also ruled that Khalil had not yet sufficiently disputed the second ground for his removal on failure to disclose information in his 2024 legal permanent resident application. The court denied Khalil's motion for a preliminary injunction on the latter, but indicated Khalil could supplement the record. \nUpdate 13: On June 11, Judge Farbiarz blocked the Trump administration from deporting pro-Palestinian Columbia University protest organizer Mahmoud Khalil, ruling that the government\u2019s effort to deport Khalil by arguing his presence would \u201chave serious adverse foreign policy consequences\u201d chills Khalil\u2019s First Amdendment Rights.\nUpdate 14:  On June 13, Judge Farbiarz found that the government may continue to detain Mahmoud Khalil on a separate immigration charge, so long as detention is not based on the government\u2019s initial determination that Khalil is a national security threat. \nThis ruling comes after the government responded to the court\u2019s June 11 order, claiming that the court did not order Khalil\u2019s release, but only barred his detention. \nUpdate 15: Judge Farbiarz ordered Mahmoud Khalil, who is currently detained by federal immigration authorities in Louisiana, be released from custody on June 20. On that same day, the government appealed Judge Farbiarz\u2019s June 11 order granting a preliminary injunction to the Third Circuit.\nNote: Mahmoud Khalil submitted a notice of claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act, seeking $20 million in damages from the administration for his detention. The notice alleges that Khalil\u2019s arrest and prolonged confinement were the result of discriminatory intent by Secretary Rubio, and that his treatment\u2014including prolonged solitary confinement and denial of medical care\u2014constituted multiple tortious acts by federal officers.2025-07-10\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Habeas Corpus and Removal of Protestors (Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats Executive Order 14161) (Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism (Executive Order 14188))Chung v. Trump (S.D.N.Y.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-02412Complaint and Habeas Petition2025-03-24Overview: Yunseo Chung, a lawful permanent resident in the U.S. and a Columbia University student who participated in protests on campus related to the war in Gaza, has sued President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and other government officials, challenging attempts to detain her under a State Department policy inspired by a recent Executive Order as a violation of her constitutional rights, including the First and Fifth amendment. The judge has temporarily blocked the government from detaining Chung or transferring her from the area of the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The government has appealed this temporary block.\nCase Summary: On January 29, 2025, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14188 (\u201cEO\u201d) declaring that the Administration would prioritize investigating \u201cpost October 7, 2023 campus anti-Semitism.\u201d An accompanying White House fact sheet explained \u201cImmediate action will be taken by the Department of Justice to protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities\u201d and that the EO \u201cdemands the removal of resident aliens who violate our laws.\u201d\nFollowing this EO, the Department of State adopted a Policy under which Secretary of State Marco Rubio would be empowered to determine whether a noncitizen\u2019s activities had \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States\u201d and to permit the Department of Homeland Security to seek to detain and deport such a person.\nOn Mar. 8, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official signed an administrative arrest warrant for Yunseo Chung, a Columbia University student and lawful U.S. permanent resident who was identified as a pro-Palestinian protestor who attended a student sit-in demonstration at Columbia on Mar. 5. \nChung has not yet been detained and has proactively filed a petition for habeas corpus asking the Court to block Trump, Rubio, and other government officials from taking enforcement action against her, including detaining her or removing her from the U.S., until a court has heard her case. She also requested that the Court vacate and set aside as unlawful Defendants\u2019 policy of targeting noncitizens for removal on the basis that the policy violates the First and Fifth Amendments.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 24, Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald granted a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 28, Defendants submitted a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 10, Chung filed a motion to expedite discovery to support her preliminary injunction motion which, if granted, would prevent her detention and transfer.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 14, Defendants replied in opposition to Chung\u2019s motion to expedite discovery.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 29, Chung filed a memorandum in further support of her motion for a preliminary injunction, emphasizing (1) that Defendants did not deny that Chung\u2019s detention constitutes viewpoint discrimination, serves no constitutionally valid purpose, and violates the constitutional prohibition on imprisonment without due process; and (2) Defendants\u2019 arguments rest on jurisdictional challenges that have been repeatedly rejected. On that same day, Chung filed a memorandum in opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, arguing that Defendants\u2019 motion ignores key language in the INA and expansively reads statutes that higher courts have repeatedly construed narrowly in alleging Chung\u2019s presence or activities in the U.S. would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences.\nUpdate 6: On May 14, Defendants replied in support of their motion to dismiss, further emphasizing their belief that the court lacks jurisdiction over Chung\u2019s claim.\nUpdate 7: On May 20, Chung filed a sur-reply in further opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss to address intervening 2nd Circuit decisions in Ozturk v. Hyde and Mahdawi v. Trump that reject Defendants\u2019 jurisdictional challenges.\nUpdate 8: On June 5, Judge Buchwald issued a preliminary injunction against Defendants, enjoining them from detaining and/or arresting Chung and from transferring Chung out of the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\nUpdate 9: On July 3, Defendants appealed Judge Buchwald\u2019s preliminary injunction order.2025-07-03\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Habeas Corpus and Removal of Protestors (Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats Executive Order 14161) (Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism (Executive Order 14188))Taal v.

The Plaintiffs argue that the EOs violate constitutional rights of free speech and due process and have asked the court to temporarily block the EOs to prevent visa revocations, detentions, and deportations while the case proceeds.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) directing federal agencies to enhance immigration screening and vetting procedures to prevent the entry of individuals who may pose a terrorist, national security, or public safety threat to the U.S. On Jan. 29, Trump issued an EO directing federal resources and civil rights enforcement authorities to combat antisemitism on higher education campuses. On March 14, 2025, the State Department notified ICE that it had revoked the F-1 student visa of a noncitizen lawfully residing in the U.S. named Momodou Taal.\nOn Mar. 15, Plaintiffs, Momodou Taal and other citizens and noncitizens lawfully residing in the United States, filed suit against Trump, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and Secretary of DHS Kristi Noem to preliminarily and permanently enjoin DHS from enforcing parts of the EOs on the grounds that they violate the First and Fifth Amendments. Plaintiffs also filed a motion requesting a TRO and preliminary injunction, seeking to temporarily block Defendants from detaining and deporting Taal and similarly situated individuals while the case proceeds.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 22, the Government filed an opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a TRO and preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 27, Judge Elizabeth Coombe denied the motion for a temporary restraining order. Coombe held that the Plaintiffs did not satisfy the high burden for a temporary restraining order. \u201cTo the extent a violation of Taal\u2019s First Amendment rights subjected him to the commencement of removal proceedings, Plaintiffs have not shown that this claim is within the jurisdiction of the Court,\u201d Coombe also wrote.\nThe court recognized that same day the Plaintiffs had simultaneously submitted an amended complaint and asked for further briefing on the effect of the judgment.

He was arrested without being charged with or accused of any crime. Dr. Suri is being held at an ICE staging center, potentially awaiting deportation. He alleges the actions of the federal agents, on behalf of the Trump administration, are in violation of the Due Process clause and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \nCase Summary: Dr. Badar Khan Suri is a Georgetown professor and postdoctoral scholar on religion and peace processes in the Middle East and South Asia who has been vocal in his support of Palestinian rights and his family\u2019s ties to Gaza. Though he lives and works legally in the United States on a research scholar and professor visa, he was arrested without charge by masked ICE agents and transferred to an immigration detention center in Louisiana to await deportation. Suri is suing the administration on the basis that his arrest is in violation of the Due Process Clause and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 20, Petitioner filed a motion to compel the respondents to return Suri to the Eastern District of Virginia and a memorandum in support of said motion.\nUpdate 2: The Court ordered that Suri shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court issues a contrary order. \nUpdate 3: Petitioner filed a motion for release on bond. \nUpdate 4: On Apr.1, respondents filed a motion to dismiss, a motion to transfer the case and opposition to the motion to compel respondents to return petitioner to the Eastern district of Virginia. \nUpdate 5: On Apr. 3, Respondents filed a response in opposition to Suri\u2019s motion for release on bond.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 15, Petitioner filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss and the motion to transfer case. \nUpdate 7: On Apr. 21, Respondents filed a reply to the response to the motion to dismiss and motion to transfer case.\nUpdate 8: On May 6, the Court found that it has habeas jurisdiction to consider the petition and consequently denied the motion to dismiss and motion to transfer venue. \nUpdate 9: On May 14th, the Court granted the petitioner\u2019s motion for release on bond.\nUpdate 10: On Jun. 10th, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.\nUpdate 11: On July 1, an appeals court denied the administration\u2019s request to stay a lower court\u2019s order requiring the release of Badar Khan Suri from immigration detention.

Rubio (D. Mass.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-10685Complaint2025-03-25Overview: Several academic groups have sued to block President Donald Trump, the Department of Homeland Security and others from implementing a deportion policy of allegedly targeting noncitizen students and faculty members who attend pro-Palestinian protests with large-scale arrests, detentions and deportations. The academic groups argue that these actions violate the First and Fifth Amendment and Administrative Procedure Act. The district court rejected the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the case, except for the Fifth Amendment claim which it did dismiss.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, President Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) directing federal agencies to enhance immigration screening and vetting procedures to prevent the entry of individuals who may pose a terrorist, national security, or public safety threat to the United States. On Jan. 29, the president issued an EO directing federal resources and civil rights enforcement authorities to combat antisemitism on higher education campuses. \nOn Mar. 25, Plaintiffs, the American Association of University Professors and other academic groups, filed suit against Trump, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and others, alleging that to implement these EOs, Defendants have engaged in an \"ideological-deportation policy\" against noncitizen students and faculty who participate in pro-Palestinian protests.\nPlaintiffs allege that the deportation policy creates a \u201cclimate of repression and fear on university campuses\u201d and prevents U.S. citizen members of the academic groups from hearing from and associating with noncitizen students and colleagues, as well as making it more difficult for members to collaborate with noncitizen students and colleagues. The academic groups allege that the policy violates the First Amendment because it \"entails the arrest, detention, and deportation of noncitizen students and faculty on the basis of, or in retaliation for, their political viewpoints\" and is \"not narrowly tailored to any compelling governmental interest.\" According to the academic groups, the policy also violates the Fifth Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act (as \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d conduct). They ask the court to block the agencies from further implementing the policy.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 1, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction and expedited briefing, asking the court to stop the agencies from implementing or enforcing the policy. \nUpdate 2: On Apr. 14, the government filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction arguing that the court lacks jurisdiction, does not violate the First Amendment, and that the balance of equities do not support granting the relief sought. On Apr. 18, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for preliminary injunction. On Apr. 23, at a hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction, the parties agreed to treat the government\u2019s response in opposition as a motion to dismiss and the court took the motion under advisement.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 29, the court granted the motion to dismiss on third count (Fifth Amendment vagueness), but denied the motion to dismiss on the first (First Amendment), second (First Amendment), and fourth (APA) counts.2025-04-29\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Habeas Corpus and Removal of Protestors (Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats Executive Order 14161) (Additional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism (Executive Order 14188))Mahdawi v.

On Apr. 24, the court ordered that Mahdawi not be removed from the United States for a period of 90 days or until the case is dismissed or a preliminary injunction is granted. On Apr. 30, the court ordered Mahdawi released on his own recognizance. The Trump Administration appealed both of these court orders, and the Court of Appeals rejected the appeal on May 9.\nCase Summary: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) detained Petitioner Mohsen Mahdawi, a lawful United States permanent resident, on Apr. 14. Mahdawi alleges he was targeted for his support of Palestine and has sued President Trump, DHS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and others alleging violations of his First Amendment and Fifth Amendment due process rights as well as violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Nondelegation Doctrine. On Apr. 14, Mahdawi filed a habeas corpus petition, requesting that the Court grant him release on bail and that the court vacate and set aside the government\u2019s alleged policy of targeting noncitizens for removal based on their exercise of their First Amendment speech rights in advocating for Palestine, as well as the Secretary of State\u2019s \u201cdetermination that the presence or activities in the United States of individuals who protested [...] \nIsrael would have potentially serious foreign policy consequences and \nwould compromise a compelling United States foreign policy interest.\u201d Mahdawi argued that the government\u2019s policy and Secretary of State\u2019s determination violate the APA by being arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, contrary to constitutional right, contrary to law, and in excess of statutory jurisdiction. Mahdawi has filed an emergency request for a temporary restraining order (TRO), which is under seal.\nOn Apr. 14, the court issued an order that he not be removed from the United States or moved out of the territory of the District of Vermont pending further order of this Court.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 22, Petitioner filed a Motion for Release on bond.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 24, the TRO was extended for 90 days or until the dismissal of the case or a grant of a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 30, the Court granted Petitioner\u2019s motion, ordering him released on his personal recognizance during the pendency of his habeas proceeding. The judge based his decision on the Petitioner\u2019s likelihood of success on the merits of his claims of Due Process, First Amendment and Fifth Amendment violations, and concluded that his release was in the public interest, as his continued detention would have a chilling effect on protected speech and was justified due to the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d surrounding his case.\nUpdate 4: On May 1, the Trump Administration appealed the Court\u2019s orders on Apr. 24 and 30, extending the TRO and granting Petitioner\u2019s motion for release, respectively.\nUpdate 5: On May 9, the Second Circuit denied the government\u2019s appeal.\nUpdate 6: On May 12, Petitioner filed a motion as to the conditions of his release, which was granted on May 14.2025-05-12\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Other Habeas and Removal ActionsGunaydin v. Trump (D. Minn.) \n\nCase No. 0:25-CV-01151Habeas petition (under seal)2025-03-30Overview: Do\u011fukan G\u00fcnaydin, a citizen of Turkey, was reportedly arrested on Mar. 27 by federal officers and had his student visa revoked. The government allegedly cited an old DUI case as the reason for the revocation. G\u00fcnaydin has filed a petition of habeas corpus challenging his arrest and continued detention.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 27, Do\u011fukan G\u00fcnaydin, a citizen of Turkey in the United States under a student visa, was reportedly arrested outside of his home by plainclothes federal officers. He filed a petition of habeas corpus on Mar. 30 arguing that his arrest was improper because his visa was canceled hours after his arrest and on the ground that it violated his constitutional due process rights. The Department of Homeland Security has stated that G\u00fcnaydin\u2019s visa was revoked because of a DUI case from 2023.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 11, G\u00fcnaydin filed an amended habeas petition. The government responded to this amended petition on Apr. 14.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 17, Judge Jeffrey Bryan found good cause exists to warrant the delay of any hearing or adjudication of G\u00fcnaydin\u2019s amended petition.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 25, G\u00fcnaydin filed a motion for a TRO along with a supporting memorandum.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 28, Judge Bryan granted in part and denied in part G\u00fcnaydin\u2019s motion for a TRO. Judge Bryan\u2019s order blocks the government respondents and other persons or agencies from removing, transferring, or otherwise facilitating the removal of G\u00fcnaydin from the District of Minnesota.\nUpdate 5: On May 12, the Court granted G\u00fcnaydin\u2019s motion to extend the TRO for an additional fourteen days while the merits of his underlying habeas action are determined.\nUpdate 6: On May 21, the Court granted G\u00fcnaydin\u2019s second amended petition for writ of habeas corpus, ordering that G\u00fcnaydin be released from custody on bond.2025-05-21\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Other Habeas and Removal ActionsJane Doe 1 v.

Noem (N.D.Cal), Case No. 3:25-cv-03292, Complaint (filed Apr. 11, 2025).\n\nOn Apr. 25, 2025, the Department of Justice informed a federal court the administration has reversed the new policy.Complaint2025-04-11Overview:  A group of F-1 student visa holders (proceeding under pseudonyms) allege that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement terminated their records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) after conducting criminal records checks, effectively ending their F-1 student visa status. The court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to prevent the termination of F-1 student visa holders' status and to restore their SEVIS registration and work authorizations.\nCase Summary: The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been terminating the F-1 student visa holder status of international students in the United States. Students and their universities often only learn of the terminations by checking the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a database used by DHS and universities to track the status of international students.17 F-1 student visa holders enrolled in United States (U.S.) academic institutions or engaged in Optional Practical Training (OPT), allege harms including loss of scholarships, career opportunities, access to education, and potential detention or deportation. Plaintiffs claim violations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for agency action not in accordance with law, exceeding statutory authority, and arbitrary and capricious conduct. They also allege violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the termination of their F-1 status and restore their SEVIS registration and work authorizations.\nUpdate 1: On April 14, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to add 116 additional students to the litigation (for a total of 133 plaintiffs).  \nUpdate 2: On April 18, the court issued a TRO to prevent the termination of F-1 student visa holders' status and restore their SEVIS registration and work authorizations.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 25, 2028, the Department of Justice informed a federal court the administration has reversed the new policy. \nUpdate 3: On May 2, the court converted the Plaintiffs\u2019 TRO into a preliminary injunction for all 133 Plaintiffs, finding that the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits as to their claims that Defendants violated the APA, and that the Plaintiffs demonstrated a substantial threat of irreparable harm.\nUpdate 4: On May 22, the court issued a nationwide preliminary injunction blocking the government from arresting, detaining, or deporting over 4,700 international students whose F-1 visa statuses were abruptly revoked without notice.2025-05-22\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Other Habeas and Removal ActionsUnited Farm Workers v. Noem (E.D. Cal.) \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00246\nNinth Circuit No. 25-4047Complaint2025-02-26Overview:   In early Jan. 2025, Border Patrol undertook \u201cOperation Return to Sender,\u201d which involved detaining and arresting individuals presumed to be illegal aliens. Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants violated the Fourth Amendment by detaining individuals without reasonable suspicion that they were in violation of immigration laws. They also allege violations of federal law because warrantless arrests were made without probable cause that the individuals were flight risks. Finally, the Plaintiffs argue that Defendants violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause because multiple individuals were coerced into signing voluntary departure agreements without first knowing the rights they\u2019d be waiving. Plaintiffs filed a class action suit challenging the three identified practices. On Apr. 29, 2025, the Court certified two of Plaintiffs\u2019 classes and granted a preliminary injunction, a decision that the Defendants have since appealed to the Ninth Circuit.\nCase Summary: In Jan. 2025, Customs and Border Protection launched \u201cOperation Return to Sender.\u201d This involved deploying Border Patrol officers to interior counties in California to arrest and ultimately deport illegal aliens. Border Patrol\u2019s activities took place in areas known to be frequented by farm workers and day laborers. The Plaintiffs are a number of individuals, including a lawful permanent resident, that were detained and arrested by Border Patrol as part of Operation Return to Sender. Plaintiffs also include individuals that argue they were deceived and coerced into voluntarily departing, along with a farm worker union whose members have been targeted by the Operation. \nPlaintiffs allege Border Patrol violated the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection from unreasonable seizure by detaining individuals without reasonable suspicion that they were in violation of immigration law. Plaintiffs further allege that the Operation violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). INA permits Border Patrol to carry out warrantless arrests only if the officer has probable cause to believe the individual is in violation of immigration law and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained. Plaintiffs argue that Border Patrol did not have probable cause because a number of those arrested had strong community and family ties. Finally, Plaintiffs allege that Border Patrol violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of due process. A number of the individuals arrested claimed that while in immigration detention centers, they were told on multiple occasions that they did not have the right to a hearing before an immigration judge or to speak to a lawyer. They also claim that they were coerced to voluntarily depart by being told it would speed up the process for obtaining legal status, by not being told it would lead to a multi-year bar on their ability to return to the United States, and by being told to sign a signature pad while being refused the ability to first see the document they were signing.  \nPlaintiffs request preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the Defendants from violating the class members\u2019 Fourth Amendment and statutory rights. They also seek an order for the return of the Plaintiffs that voluntarily departed. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 7, 2025, the Plaintiffs moved to provisionally certify two of Plaintiffs\u2019 classes. They also moved for a preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 2: On Apr. 7, 2025, the Defendants filed oppositions to the Plaintiffs\u2019 motions for preliminary injunction and to provisionally certify the classes. With regard to the opposition to the preliminary injunction, Defendants argue that the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the claims or to enter class-wide injunctions. The Defendants also argue that the Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are mooted because the Border Patrol office responsible for Eastern California issued policy and guidance on April 4, 2025 regarding the need for reasonable suspicion for detentions and probable cause for warrantless arrests, and it plans to conduct training sessions in the near future. \nUpdate 3: On Apr. 29, 2025, the Court granted the Plaintiffs\u2019 motions for provisional class certification for the Suspicionless Stop and Warrantless Arrest classes and for a preliminary injunction. The injunction requires that, among other things, Border Patrol stop conducting detention stops without reasonable suspicion that the person stopped is in violation of immigration law and stop effecting warrantless arrests without probable cause that the individual is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained. With regard to the Defendants\u2019 mootness argument, the Court found that the policy issued by Defendants was too geographically limited, failed to address all of the objectionable measures alleged by the Plaintiffs, and too tenuously situated to meet the requirement that the wrongful behavior could not be reasonably expected to recur.\nUpdate 4: On June 26, the Defendants appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.2025-06-26\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Other Habeas and Removal ActionsDvortsin as Next Friend of Hayam El Gamal et al., Petitioner, v.

The dismissal effectively lifts the block on the administration from removing the family from Texas.

Feb. 18, 2025)D.V.D. v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security (D. Mass.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-10676\n\nFirst Circuit Case No. 25-1311Complaint2025-03-23Overview: A group of noncitizens sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to challenge its practice of deporting noncitizens to a country that is not their country or origin or citizenship (i.e., a \u201cthird country\u201d) without first providing them with notice or opportunity to contest. Plaintiffs claim that DHS\u2019s practice violates multiple statutes and the Constitution. Plaintiffs asked the court to at least temporarily block deportations on an emergency basis while the case proceeds. A federal judge agreed to temporarily block this conduct, and the government has appealed this decision to the First Circuit Court of Appeals and U.S. Supreme Court.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 18, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a policy directive instructing officers to review all cases of individuals previously released from immigration detention for re-dentention and removal to a \u201cthird country\u201d (i.e., a country that differs from their countries of origin and/or citizenship). A class of noncitizens with final removal orders has sued DHS challenging the practice of deporting individuals to a third country without providing notice or opportunity to contest. Plaintiffs claim that DHS\u2019s practice violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the Convention Against Torture as implemented in domestic law. \n\nPlaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment stating that DHS\u2019s practice is unlawful and violates their statutory, regulatory, and constitutional rights; seek to enjoin Defendants from failing to provide written notice and a meaningful opportunity to present a fear-based claim; and to order Defendants to return class members that have been removed to a third country. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 23, the same day the complaint was filed, Plaintiffs also filed a motion for an emergency temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction and stay of administrative action.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 25, Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an emergency TRO and preliminary injunction and stay of administrative action.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 28, Judge Brian Murphy granted Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a TRO, blocking Defendants from removing individuals subject to a final order of removal from the United States to a third country, unless Defendants can show that they were provided written notice and a meaningful opportunity to present a fear-based claim.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 28, the Defendants submitted a notice of appeal to the First Circuit.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 29, Defendants filed a Motion for partial stay of the TRO pending appeal, arguing a nationwide injunction of this kind is unlawful and improper. Judge Murphy denied this motion on the same day, citing the memorandum supporting granting of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for TRO.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 7, the First Circuit denied the stay on jurisdictional grounds involving the temporary status of the district court\u2019s order. The appeals court stated that the government\u2019s issuance of intervening Guidance Regarding Third Country Removals \u201cmade a moving target of their removal policy\u201d that \u201conly reinforces the temporary nature of the relief at issue.\u201d\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 8, the Plaintiffs filed a reply in the district court in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction, claiming that they are likely to succeed on the merits and that they face irreparable harm if deported to a third country without documented notice or an opportunity to present their claims before an immigration judge.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 18, Judge Murphy granted class certification and a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 22, the government appealed the Apr. 18 preliminary injunction order to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.\nUpdate 10: On Apr. 23, the Defendants submitted a filing stating that the Defense Department transported four Venezuelan nationals to El Salvador following the court\u2019s Mar. 28 TRO, but that \u201cthe Department of Defense is not a defendant in this action.\u201d\nUpdate 11: On Apr. 29, the Plaintiffs filed a motion in support of amending the preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 12: On Apr. 30, the court amended the preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 13: On May 7, Plaintiffs filed a motion for an emergency TRO following reports of Defendants\u2019 imminent removal of Laotian, Vietnamese, and Philippine class members to Libya. That same day, Judge Murphy responded by issuing a clarifying order of his April 30 amendment to the preliminary injunction order finding Defendants' allegedly imminent removals to be in violation of the preliminary injunction order.\nUpdate 14: On May 16, the government submitted a Notice of Errata and accompanying affidavit for an \u201cerror\u201d in its prior affidavit about plaintiff O.C.G. The Notice states that, contrary to an earlier affidavit, \u201cUpon further investigation, Defendants cannot identify any officer who asked O.C.G. whether he had a fear of return to Mexico. Nor can Defendants identify the officer who O.C.G. states \u2018told [him] that he was being deported to Mexico.\u2019\u201d\nUpdate 15: On May 18, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction noting the Notice of Errata and also alleging that the government had released the plaintiff's name publicly, in violation of court orders, which put his life at increased risk. The plaintiff requests a judicial order for the return of O.C.G.\nUpdate 16: On May 20, Judge Murphy ordered the Defendants to maintain custody and control of class members currently being removed to South Sudan or to any other third country and to ensure the practical feasibility of their return if the court finds that such removals were unlawful. The court also ordered that Defendants be prepared by the next hearing, scheduled for May 21, to identify the time and manner of notice each individual in the affected class received as to their third-country removal, and what opportunity each individual had to raise a fear-based claim.\nUpdate 17: On May 21, following an emergency hearing, Judge Murphy found the government violated the court\u2019s preliminary injunction by deporting at least six members of the class to South Sudan without meaningful opportunity to assert claims of protection under the Torture Convention. Judge Murphy held that \u201cno reasonable interpretation of the Court\u2019s Preliminary Injunction\u201d could endorse the government\u2019s action. The court issued a \u201csummary and clarification\u201d of the injunction requiring removal to a third country to include written notice to both the non-citizen and the non-citizen\u2019s counsel in a language the non-citizen can understand, and a meaningful opportunity and a minimum of ten days to raise a fear-based claim for Torture Convention protection (plus an additional 15 days if to seek reopening of immigration proceedings if initially denied).\n\nAlso following the emergency hearing, Judge Murphy issued a separate order to remedy the violation of the preliminary injunction. It requires giving the six individuals a reasonable fear of torture interview including access to counsel, an interpreter, and technology for transfer of documents  \u201ccommensurate with the access that they would have received had these procedures occurred within the United States prior to their deportation.\u201d\nUpdate 18: On May 23, Judge Murphy granted a preliminary injunction requiring the government to \u201cto take all immediate steps, including coordinating with Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, to facilitate the return of O.C.G. to the United States.\u201d Judge Murphy stated the situation for O.G.C. should be easier for the Defendants to remedy since he is not held by a foreign government and the Defendants have not made any argument that it would be \u201ccostly, burdensome, or otherwise impede the government\u2019s objectives\u201d to facilitate his return.\nUpdate 19: On May 26, Judge Murphy rejected DHS\u2019s bid to undo a ruling that it unlawfully deported six men, formerly held in ICE custody, without giving them a fair chance to seek protection from torture. The men are now detained at a U.S. military base in Djibouti. The court noted that DHS had previously agreed it could comply with the court\u2019s proposed process, but then reversed course.\nUpdate 20: On May 27, the government appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the district court's Apr. 18 preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 21: On Jun. 4, O.G.C.\u2019s attorney stated that his client was flowing back to the United States.\nUpdate 22: On Jun. 23, the Supreme Court stopped a lower court\u2019s order which has prevented the administration from removing immigrants to third countries without an opportunity to present their claims of potential torture first. The Supreme Court\u2019s order is now in place while the litigation proceeds. \nJustices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented.\nUpdate 23: On June 24, the administration filed an emergency motion asking the Supreme Court to clarify that its June 23 order staying a district court injunction also nullifies that court\u2019s related enforcement orders. The administration argues that the district court defied the Supreme Court\u2019s authority by continuing to enforce its injunction barring the removal of individuals with criminal convictions currently detained in Djibouti.\nUpdate 24: On June 30, the First Circuit dismissed the appeal pursuant to DHS\u2019s assented-to motion for voluntary dismissal.\nUpdate 25: On July 3, the Supreme Court granted the administration\u2019s request to clarify that its June 23 order fully blocks all components of a lower court\u2019s injunction that had prevented the administration from removing immigrants to third countries without an opportunity to present their claims of potential torture first. In a 7\u20132 decision, the Court confirmed that the stay applies in full, including the district court\u2019s related enforcement orders that had prevented the removal of eight migrants to South Sudan.\nUpdate 26: On July 4, Judge Murphy denied an emergency motion to prevent the deportation of eight men to South Sudan. The petitioners filed a separate Habeas Corpus motion on July 3, which Judge Moss transferred from the D.C. District court to Massachusetts. Judge Murphy held that the Supreme Court\u2019s order in DVD v. DHS is binding in the new petition as the petition is substantially similar to the previous case.

Dept of Health and Human Services (D.D.C.)\n\nCase no. 1:25-cv-01405\nComplaint2025-05-08Overview:  A group of nonprofit organizations brought a class action lawsuit on behalf of unaccompanied children currently in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (\u201cORR\u201d), challenging recent policy changes that have prevented the children' s prompt release to sponsors in the US. In March 2025, ORR allegedly began violating its own regulations by refusing to release children to family members in the US based on their immigration status or because they lacked specific identification documentation. On Mar. 24, the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) issued an Interim Final Rule (\u201cIFR\u201d) rescinding restrictions related to denials based on immigration status and information collection for immigration enforcement purposes. The Plaintiffs are challenging the issuance of the IFR and the changes to ORR\u2019s sponsor requirements, claiming that they violate several provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d).\nCase Summary: On Mar. 24, the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) issued an Interim Final Rule (\u201cIFR\u201d) rescinding the portions of 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 410.1201(b) related to denying the sponsorship of unaccompanied children currently in federal immigration custody in the US to family sponsors based on the family members\u2019 immigration status and information collection for immigration enforcement purposes.\nA number of nonprofit organizations brought a class action lawsuit on behalf of children in federal immigration custody who have not been released to a sponsor because of ORR\u2019s new documentation requirements, and a nonprofit organization which is now unable to advocate for their immigrant clients because of the IFR and ORR\u2019s policy changes. Plaintiffs assert that the IFR and new sponsorship requirements violate several sections of the APA: they were issued without observance of procedure required by law, they were contrary to law and beyond statutory authority, they violate constitutional rights, and are arbitrary and capricious. Plaintiffs ask the Court to certify the class action, to hold unlawful and set aside the IFR and the Mar. 7 and Apr. 15, revisions of the ORR Policy Guide Section 2.2.4, and to enter enter a preliminary injunction either staying the effective date of the IFR or prohibiting ORR from enforcing its new identification requirements.2025-05-08\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Biometric information and registration (Interim Final Rule: Alien Registration Form and Evidence of Registration)Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights v. U.S. Department of  Homeland Security ( D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00943  Complaint2025-03-31Overview:  A group of nonprofit member-based organisations that provide services to immigrant communities sued to block the implementation of an interim final rule (IFR) due to go into effect on April 11, 2025 that creates new registration requirements, including the provision of biometric information, for all noncitizens 14 years or older and for parents and legal guardians of unregistered children younger than 14. Plaintiffs claim that the IFR violates the procedural and substantive requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). On April 10, the court denied the motion for a stay and preliminary judgement. The nonprofit organizations appealed this decision to the D.C. Circuit on April 24.\nCase Summary: On March 12, 2025 the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), an agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), issued an interim final rule (IFR) designating a new registration form for noncitizens to register with the Federal government. The IFR was issued to implement President Trump\u2019s Executive Order 14159 (EO) instructing that all previously unregistered aliens had to comply with registration requirements and ensuring that failure to comply was treated as a civil and criminal enforcement priority. The process created by the IFR initiates the collection of biometrics and would result in the creation of an alien registration document, and notes that existing federal regulations require noncitizens to carry proof of registration at all times. The IFR is due to go into effect on April 11.\n\nA group of nonprofit member-based organisations that provide a wide range of services to immigrant communities sued on March 31 alleging that the IFR, which is available only in English, represents the imposition of a confusing and inconsistent new universal registration scheme with attendant civil and criminal liabilities which will impact a huge number of noncitizens and irreparably harm their members. Plaintiffs allege that the rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (by implementing policies that are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law) and \u00a7 706(2)(D) (by failing to follow the required rulemaking process, including providing public notice and opportunity to comment on legislative rules).\nThe Plaintiffs seek an order and preliminary injunction staying or postponing the effective dates of the IFR and a declaratory judgment that the IFR is unlawful and enjoining the enforcement or implementation of the rule.\nUpdate 1: On April 10 the District Court denied the motion for a stay and preliminary injunction on the basis that the Plaintiffs lack standing. The Court ruled that the Plaintiffs lacked both organisational and associational standing.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 24, Plaintiffs appealed the District Court\u2019s Apr. 10 order that denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a stay and preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit. On that same day, Plaintiffs also filed a motion for an injunction to preserve status quo ante and protect Plaintiffs and their members from irreparable harm pending their appeal of the Apr. 10 order.\nUpdate 3: On June 12, the District Court denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an injunction pending their appeal of the Court\u2019s April 10 denial of their motion for a preliminary injunction. The Court found that Plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm, thereby failing to satisfy a key element for injunctions. \nUpdate 4: On June 25, Plaintiffs appealed the District Court\u2019s June 12 order that denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit.2025-06-25\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Construction of Federal Detention FacilitiesFriends of the Everglades, Inc. v. Noem (S.D.

Two nonprofit conservation organizations seek to block the construction of the facility, arguing that the Defendants are violating the National Environmental Policy Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and Florida state law. \nCase Summary: In June 2025, Florida announced a collaboration with the federal government to build a mass federal detention facility for up to 5,000 noncitizen detainees at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport (TNT Site). The facility has been dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz.\u201d Friends of the Everglades, a non-profit organization focused on protecting the Everglades, and the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit conservation organization, filed a complaint on June 27, 2025, seeking to block the construction of the facility. The Plaintiffs argue that the Defendants, which include Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Todd Lyons, Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and two Florida state parties, violate federal and state environmental laws because of their failure to conduct environmental reviews. Plaintiffs, who are suing on behalf of their members, claim that their members have an interest in preserving the Everglades because they derive recreational, educational, aesthetic, and other benefits from the preserve and any environmental damage to the area would thus harm their members. \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants are violating the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by failing to prepare statutorily required environmental assessments or environmental impact statements. Plaintiffs further argue that the federal Defendants are in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for taking action that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and contrary to the law. They argue that DHS and ICE violate the APA by failing to provide the public with an opportunity for notice and comment and by failing to undergo required environmental review under NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Park Service Organic Act of 1916. Plaintiffs also argue that the Florida state Defendants are in violation of Florida state law. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief. 2025-06-27\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Construction of Federal Detention FacilitiesVan Schaick v. DeSantis (N.D.

The municipalities cite harm to their tax base, businesses, and public safety, alleging the operations mark a break from decades of lawful warrant-based arrests and instill widespread fear across immigrant communities. The motion follows an amicus brief supporting the class action lawsuit by California and sixteen other states supporting the plaintiffs.\nUpdate 2: On July 11, the district court granted a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 3: On July 13, Defendants appealed the decision to the Ninth CIrcuit.\nUpdate 4: On July 17, the district court denied the administration\u2019s motion to stay the Temporary Restraining Order pending appeal, which restricts the administration from engaging in indiscriminate immigration stops in the Los Angeles area and denying detainees access to lawyers. The court rejected the administration\u2019s argument that the TRO causes irreparable harm and creates a chilling effect on enforcing immigration law, because \u201c[c]omplying with the law does not impose harm\u201d and the TRO is sufficiently clear that it would not cause confusion.2025-07-17\n\n\nImmigration and CitizenshipExecutive Action: Immigration Raids and ArrestsImmigrant Advocates Response Collaborative v.

NTEU argues the EO violates civil servant protection laws.\nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s executive order authorizes the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to reclassify thousands of members of the civil service and strip them of their civil-service protections, enabling the president or heads of agencies to fire them at will. The National Treasury Employees Union sued to block implementation of the order on behalf of the union\u2019s members. The lawsuit argues that the executive order violates laws Congress passed to provide civil-service protections to the vast majority of civil servants, with only limited exceptions for Senate-confirmed political appointees.\nUpdate 1: On June 26, 2025, the Court granted Defendant\u2019s Consent Motion for a Stay, in which Defendants argued that given that a final rule concerning civil-service protections was anticipated later this year, as well as the existence of similar ongoing litigation, \u201cit would conserve the parties\u2019 resources and promote judicial economy to litigate all challenges to Defendants\u2019 actions on the same timeline and to focus all litigation on the anticipated final rule.\u201d2025-06-26\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Reinstatement of Schedule F for Policy/Career Employees (Executive Order 14171)Government Accountability Project v.

The lawsuit seeks to block the EO\u2019s implementation and argues that the EO violates the Administrative Procedure Act and deprives civil servants of their rights under the Constitution and the Civil Service Reform Act. \nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s executive order authorizes the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to reclassify thousands of members of the civil service and strip them of their civil-service protections, enabling the president or heads of agencies to fire them at will. PEER, represented by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and Democracy Forward, sued to enjoin implementation of the executive order. The lawsuit argues that the executive order violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and deprives civil servants of due process by stripping them of protections guaranteed under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 12, plaintiff filed a first amended complaint. The amended complaint asks the court to declare the executive order ultra vires, in violation of the APA as contrary to the Civil Service Reform Act, as well as by failing to undertake required rulemaking processes, and in violation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. 2025-03-12\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Reinstatement of Schedule F for Policy/Career Employees (Executive Order 14171)American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO and American Federation of State, County And Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO  v.

The unions argue that the EO violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The Trump Administration has moved to dismiss the labor unions\u2019 complaint. \nCase Summary: On Jan. 27, Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Charles Ezell issued guidance implementing the president\u2019s executive order, which aims to reclassify thousands of members of the civil service and strip them of their civil-service protections, enabling the president or heads of agencies to fire them at will. The AFGE and AFSCME \u2013 labor organizations representing federal, state and local employees \u2013 assert that the Trump administration failed to follow proper notice-and-comment procedures under the Administrative Procedural Act (APA) in issuing the order, which renders \u201cinoperative or without effect\u201d existing regulations, 5 C.F.R. 210.102(b)(3), 5 C.F.R. 210.102(b)(4), and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.601-603. The plaintiffs sued, seeking a declaratory judgment to that effect, as well as an injunction enjoining the Defendants from enforcing the order without first complying with the APA\u2019s notice-and-comment requirements.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 22, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted and for lack of jurisdiction. They assert Plaintiffs\u2019 claims fail regardless of jurisdiction because the APA requires final agency action, which they believe is not present in this case, and the APA does not apply to the President when he acts directly.2025-04-22\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Establishment of \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d (DOGE) (Executive Order 14158 and Executive Order 14219) Public Citizen Inc et al v.

Two other cases,  Lentini v. Department of Government Efficiency and American Public Health Association v. Office of Budget and Management, have now been consolidated under this case. \nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s executive order renames the U.S. Digital Service as the U.S. DOGE Service (Department of Government Efficiency) and reestablishes the office under the Executive Office of the President. Two advocacy organizations and the American Federation of Government Employees sued, arguing that the order violates the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which bars the delegation of decision-making authority to private citizens without public access. The suit asks the court to enjoin the operation of DOGE unless and until it complies with the FACA\u2019s requirements.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 18, 2025, Judge Jia M. Cobb (D.D.C.) granted defendants\u2019 motion to consolidate two cases with this case. Parties in Lentini v. Department of Government Efficiency (complaint), and American Public Health Association v. Office of Budget and Management (complaint) must make all future filings in this case.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 3, 2025, Public Citizen Plaintiffs dismissed their action without prejudice. The Lentini Plaintiffs in Lentini v. Department of Government Efficiency and American Public Health Association Plaintiffs remain in American Public Health Association v. Office of Budget and Management. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 3, Plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited discovery, arguing that Musk\u2019s actions with DOGE are ultra vires and lack transparency, which necessitates deposition of key officials to support their preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 4: On Mar. 17, Defendant filed a reply in opposition to the expedited motion, arguing that Musk plays an advisory role, Plaintiffs\u2019 discovery request is premature, and the court should first resolve the motion to dismiss.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 22, 2025, the Plaintiffs submitted new evidence based on Elon Musk\u2019s private lawyers claiming that he is a \u201chigh-ranking government official\u201d and that the White House designated Musk a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d in charge of establishing and implementing DOGE. The plaintiffs claim that this is the first statement about Musk's role in DOGE that can be attributed to Musk himself, which demonstrates a need for the Court to authorize requested depositions to ascertain Musk\u2019s exact role in DOGE.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 25, Judge Jia M. Cobb denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for expedited discovery, holding that Plaintiffs lacked a pending injunction, sought broad depositions of senior officials without justification, imposed undue burden on Defendants, and requested discovery prematurely before Defendants' motion to dismiss was resolved.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 11, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and supporting memorandum for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim.\nUpdate 8: On May 12, Plaintiffs American Health Association, American Federation of Teachers, Minority Veterans of America, Votevets Action Fund, Center for Auto Safety Inc., and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington voluntarily dismissed their claims without prejudice.

On March 18, the Court ordered DOGE to halt its dismantling of USAID and to obtain express authorization from USAID officials for all future actions taken related to USAID. On March 21, Musk and DOGE appealed this decision. \nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s executive order renames the U.S. Digital Service as the U.S. DOGE Service (Department of Government Efficiency) and reestablishes the office under the Executive Office of the President. Twenty-six current and former USAID employees or contractors filed a lawsuit claiming that Elon Musk\u2019s constitutional authority to exercise significant government powers as the head of DOGE without Senate confirmation violates the Appointments Clause. The complaint alleges that Musk and the DOGE staff are exercising \u201csignificant authority\u201d by controlling agency operations, making personnel decisions, and directing federal spending, all powers the plaintiffs claim can be wielded only by properly appointed officers of the United States. The lawsuit argues that Musk is functioning as a principal officer while evading the constitutional requirement for Senate confirmation. The plaintiffs also claim that Musk\u2019s actions would be unconstitutional even if he were considered merely an inferior officer, as Congress has not authorized the President to directly appoint anyone to his position. The plaintiffs also argue that DOGE\u2019s structure violates separation of powers by creating a \u201cshadow chain of command\u201d that undermines Congress\u2019s power to create agencies and their authorities through statute, confirm appointed officers, and conduct oversight. The suit asks the court to declare Musk and DOGE to be acting unlawfully, enjoin Musk and DOGE from exercising government authority unless appointed by proper process, and set aside their actions taken to date.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 18, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 24, Defendants filed a motion in response to the request for a preliminary injunction; to which the Plaintiffs replied  on Feb. 26.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 18, the Court granted in part and denied in part the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the Plaintiffs demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and risk of irreparable harm. The Court ordered DOGE to reinstate access to email, payments, security notifications, and other electronic systems. The Court did not enjoin Defendants from carrying out mass personnel and contract terminations but did enjoin them from taking further action in a number of categories such as additional personnel and contract terminations and closures of offices.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 19, Defendants filed a motion for clarification or modification of the preliminary injunction order issued by the Court on Mar. 18, claiming Jeremy Lewin should not be bound by the preliminary injunction because he is no longer the DOGE Team Lead at USAID.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 20, the court denied Defendant\u2019s motion for clarification or modification of the preliminary injunction order, confirming Lewin is bound by the preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 21, Defendants appealed the Court\u2019s preliminary injunction and denial of Defendants\u2019 motion for clarification or modification to the Fourth Circuit. \nUpdate 7: On Mar. 25, the Court ordered that the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction be stayed until the close of business on Thurs., Mar. 27.\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 28, the Fourth Circuit granted the Defendants\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 17, Plaintiffs amended their complaint. Plaintiffs added no additional claims but did request additional forms of relief, including requests that the Court declare the actions taken by Musk and DOGE at USAID unlawful; block Defendants from taking further actions to unlawfully modify, reorganize, or eliminate USAID; and block Musk and his DOGE subordinates from interfering with USAID.\nUpdate 10: On Apr. 25, Plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited discovery related to their Appointments Clause and Separation of Powers constitutional claims. Defendants opposed this motion on May 2.\nUpdate 11: On May 1, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and a supporting memorandum, asserting that the Plaintiffs do not have jurisdiction and they fail to state a claim.\nUpdate 12: On May 30, Plaintiffs filed their second amended class action complaint, but did not amend any of the allegations included in the Apr. 17 amended complaint.\nUpdate 13: On June 9, the Fourth Circuit granted the Defendants\u2019 motion for abeyance until the district court resolves the motion to dismiss or otherwise issues any subsequent appealable order.2025-06-09\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Establishment of \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d (DOGE) (Executive Order 14158 and Executive Order 14219) New Mexico et al. v.

A federal court denied the request to temporarily block further actions by Musk and DOGE but acknowledged potential constitutional issues with Musk\u2019s appointment and ordered Musk and DOGE to provide documents and information requested by the states.\nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s executive order renames the U.S. Digital Service as the U.S. DOGE Service (Department of Government Efficiency) and reestablishes the office under the Executive Office of the President. Fourteen states filed a lawsuit claiming that Elon Musk\u2019s constitutional authority to exercise significant government powers as the head of DOGE without Senate confirmation violates the Appointments Clause. The complaint alleges that Musk and the DOGE staff are exercising \u201csignificant authority\u201d by controlling agency operations, making personnel decisions, and directing federal spending, all powers they claim can only be wielded by properly appointed officers of the United States. The suit asks the court to declare Musk and DOGE to be acting unlawfully, impose a temporary restraining order barring Musk and DOGE from exercising government authority (including a specific list of official actions) while awaiting preliminary and permanent injunctions to the same effect, and set aside their actions taken to date. \nUpdate 1: On Feb. 17, the government submitted a declaration by Joshua Fisher, Director of the Office of Administration, stating that Musk is not the head of DOGE nor an employee of DOGE.\nUpdate 2: On Feb 18, Judge Tanya Chutkan denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order but also indicated a potentially favorable view of the Plaintiffs\u2019 argument on the merits (pp. 8-9). \nUpdate 3: On Feb. 24, plaintiff states filed a motion for expedited discovery relating to an upcoming motion for a preliminary injunction.

Defendants filed their opposition in response to this motion on Apr. 24, challenging the court\u2019s jurisdiction over Plaintiff\u2019s claims and asserting Plaintiff cannot meet the standard for expedited discovery because there is no emergency or preliminary relief pending or scheduled.\nUpdate 3: On May 1, Plaintiff filed a reply in support of its motion to expedite discovery.2025-05-01\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Solicitation of information from career employeesJane Does 1-2 v. Office of Personnel Management (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00234   Complaint2025-01-27Overview: Two federal employees brought a class action lawsuit against the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) alleging that OPM used an unauthorized email system to collect data on all civilian federal workers without conducting a required privacy assessment. A federal court denied the request to halt OPM\u2019s actions and OPM has since moved to dismiss the case. \nCase Summary: The Office of Personnel Management announced it was testing a new system to email all civilian federal employees from a single email address, HR@opm.gov. Individuals claiming to be OPM employees subsequently posted online that the emails were being stored on an unsecure server at OPM. Plaintiffs, employees of executive-branch agencies who received \u201ctest\u201d emails from HR@opm.gov requesting information, sued. The lawsuit alleges that the new procedure violates the E-Government Act of 2002 and asks the court to require the Office of Personnel Management to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment before collecting any data from employees, as required under the law.\nUpdate 1 and 2: On Feb. 4, 2025, the plaintiffs requested a temporary restraining order. On Feb. 6, Judge Randolph D.

Scott Bessent et al (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00313 Complaint2025-02-03Overview: A group of labor unions representing federal employees sued Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent and others alleging that individuals affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency (\u201cDOGE\u201d) were granted unauthorized access to sensitive Treasury Department records in violation of the Privacy Act and the IRS Code. Both parties agreed to an order limiting access to Treasury payment records to specific individuals with \u201cread-only\u201d access.  \nCase Summary: The complaint alleges that the Treasury Department granted DOGE-affiliated individuals access to sensitive personal and financial information maintained by the Treasury Department. The plaintiffs sued on behalf of members whose records may have been transmitted from the Treasury Department to DOGE employees, thus allegedly depriving the members of privacy. The lawsuit seeks an injunction and declaratory relief, as well as a temporary restraining order, for alleged violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and actions in excess of legal authority under the Privacy Act.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 6, 2025, the parties in the suit mutually proposed an order that Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly adopted. It limits access to Treasury Department payment records and systems to two (Musk-affiliated) Special Government Employees in the Department (\u201cread-only\u201d access), other employees who need to access the record to perform their duties, or individuals who are already entitled to access the records under statute.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 20, the court issued an order accepting an unopposed motion to modify the Feb. 6 order.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 25, following a hearing the previous day, the court ordered \u201cthat Defendants shall file the administrative record underlying the decisions challenged in this case on or before March 10, 2025.\u201d\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 7, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction on the grounds that plaintiffs have not cleared the \u201chigh standard\u201d of showing a likelihood of an irreparable injury that is \u201cbeyond remediation.\u201d She noted, \u201cIf Plaintiffs could show that Defendants imminently planned to make their private information public or to share that information with individuals outside the federal government\nwith no obligation to maintain its confidentiality, the Court would not hesitate to find a likelihood of irreparable harm.\u201d \nUpdate 5: On Apr. 11, Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for summary judgment in their favor. Defendant\u2019s memorandum of support (referencing their statement of facts) asserts that Plaintiffs have not suffered a concrete injury, as records allegedly transmitted from the Treasury Department to DOGE employees could be lawfully shared. The memorandum also argues that plaintiffs fail to state a proper claim under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and that there is no genuine dispute of material fact. \nUpdate 6: On Apr. 25, Plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, memorandum in support, and statement of undisputed facts. In this cross-motion, Plaintiffs assert they have standing and that Defendants\u2019 actions are in violation of the APA for being arbitrary and capricious. Plaintiffs request that the court enjoin Defendants from permitting the Treasury DOGE Team to access personal information in the Bureau's systems.\nOn that same day, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and a statement of undisputed facts.\nUpdate 7: On May 9, the Defendants filed a combined reply in support of their motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, and opposition to the Plaintiffs\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment. The reply alleged that the Plaintiffs lack Article III standing, the complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim, or, alternatively, summary judgment should be entered in defendants\u2019 favor.2025-05-09\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Disclosure of personal and financial records to DOGENew York et al v. Donald J. Trump (S.D.N.Y.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01144-JAVComplaint2025-02-07Overview: Nineteen state attorneys general sued President Donald Trump and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent alleging that individuals affiliated with the Department of Government Efficiency (\u201cDOGE\u201d) were granted unauthorized access to sensitive Treasury Department records in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Privacy Act, and other ethics statutes. A federal court temporarily blocked DOGE\u2019s access to certain payment records maintained by the Treasury Department containing sensitive data while the case proceeds, citing potential violations of federal law, but has since determined that DOGE staffers who underwent training and vetting procedures may access certain sensitive systems.   \nCase Summary: The complaint alleges that the Treasury Department granted DOGE-affiliated individuals access to sensitive personal and financial information maintained by the Treasury Department. The plaintiffs, attorneys general of 19 states, sued on the ground that the policy of giving expanded access to political appointees and \u201cspecial government employees\u201d to Treasury\u2019s Bureau of Fiscal Services violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs claim the policy violates the APA by exceeding authority conferred by statute for the unauthorized purpose of impeding payments and accessing private information; for failure to conduct a privacy impact statement; for violation of the Privacy Act; and for violating ethics statutes on conflicts of interest. The plaintiffs also assert the policy usurps congressional authority and is ultra virus.\nThe plaintiffs requested an emergency temporary restraining order, as well as preliminary and permanent injunction to bar access to political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from other agencies as well as to any person who has not received a background check, security clearance, and information security training.\nUpdate 1: The case is before Judge Jeannette A. Vargas. On Feb. 8, 2025, after midnight, Judge Paul A. Engelmayer issued an emergency temporary restraining order until Judge Vargas holds a hearing on Feb. 14. Judge Engelmayer\u2019s order prohibits access to the Treasury Department\u2019s systems and also requires prohibited persons to immediately destroy any material already downloaded from the Treasury Department\u2019s systems.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 21, Judge Vargas granted a limited preliminary injunction, enjoining the Treasury Department from granting access to DOGE-affiliated individuals to any payment record, payment systems, or any other data systems maintained by the Treasury Department containing personally identifiable information and/or confidential financial information of payees. The court noted that \u201ca real possibility exists that sensitive information has already been shared outside of the Treasury Department, in potential violation of federal law.\u201d  The court ordered the Treasury Department to submit a report by March 24 including several forms of information and certifications including \u201cthe vetting and security clearances processes that members of the Treasury DOGE Team have undergone;\u201d \u201dsetting forth the legal authority pursuant to which each DOGE Team member was employed by or detailed to the Treasury Department;\u201d and \u201cexplaining the reporting chains that govern the relationship between the DOGE Team members, USDS/DOGE, and Treasury leadership.\u201d\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 7, plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration to the court\u2019s Feb. 21 ruling that states\u2019 interests do not fall within personal identifying information (PII) protections of the Privacy Act of 1973 and E-Government Act of 2002.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 10, defendants filed a motion and accompanying memo to partially dissolve the preliminary injunction as applied to Treasury Department employee Ryan Wunderly, who was appointed as Special Advisor for Information Technology and Modernization on Feb. 19, 2025. Defendants claim that they have addressed the Court\u2019s concerns regarding the processes governing Wunderly\u2019s hiring, reporting chains, training, vetting and security clearance, and anticipated access to Treasury systems. On Mar. 14, plaintiffs filed a memo in opposition to defendants\u2019 motion. On Mar. 17, defendants replied to plaintiffs\u2019 memo. On Apr. 11, the Court granted defendants\u2019 request.\nUpdate 5: On May 1, 2025, defendants filed a motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction, claiming that they have provided the information requested by the Court in its Feb. 21 order granting the preliminary injunction, and documented that they have used appropriate processes for hiring, reporting, training, vetting, and mitigation with respect to all of the members of the Treasury DOGE Team.\nUpdate 6: On May 23, plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint, which specified the APA Contrary to Law and Arbitrary and Capricious claims are against Treasury and Secretary Bessent and removed the ultra vires claim. This amended complaint also requested a permanent injunction barring Agency Defendants from implementing a new process for reviewing federal funding payment requests for the purpose of pausing and potentially blocking disbursement of funds based on ideological criteria.\nUpdate 7: On May 27, Judge Vargas determined that DOGE staffers who underwent training and vetting procedures may access sensitive Treasury data. In her decision, the judge found that the government had complied with her earlier requests to demonstrate it is equipped to screen and train employees before granting them access.2025-05-27\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Disclosure of personal and financial records to DOGEAFL-CIO v. Dep\u2019t of Labor (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00339Complaint2025-02-05Overview: A coalition of labor unions sued the Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d), the Department of Government Efficiency (\u201cDOGE\u201d), and others seeking to block DOGE's access to internal DOL information systems on the basis that such access violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the Privacy Act, the Economy Act, and other federal laws. A federal court denied requests to temporarily block DOGE\u2019s access while the case proceeds, but indicated further analysis was needed in particular on the Economy Act claims. \nCase Summary: On Feb. 5, 2025, DOGE sought access to internal information systems at the Department of Labor. Plaintiffs sued, arguing DOGE\u2019s attempt to direct the agency and access internal information systems are an unlawful exercise of power beyond its authority; and unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act as a prohibited personnel practice, violation of the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act, violation of the Privacy Act, rulemaking without proper procedure, and arbitrary and capricious abuse of discretion. They seek temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief to prevent the Department of Labor from granting access to DOGE, from taking adverse action against employees who refuse to cooperate with DOGE, and from providing any person with non-public Department of Labor information regarding that person\u2019s business interests or direct competitors. \nOn the same day as the complaint was filed, judge John Bates issued an Order which stated, \u201cDefendants represented to the Court that DOL [Department of Labor] will not allow DOGE access to any DOL data until after this Court rules on the TRO motion on Friday.\u201d\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 7, Judge Bates denied the petition for a temporary restraining order on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 12, Plaintiffs submitted a renewed request for a TRO enjoining agency defendants from granting members of DOGE access to their systems of records, except as consistent with applicable federal law.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 14, Judge Bates denied the renewed request for a TRO, but added, \u201cOn the Economy Act question, which is the most important for this denial of a TRO, the Court will benefit from further briefing and analysis on a motion for preliminary injunction.\u201d\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 27, Judge Bates ordered limited expedited discovery in the case in the form of answers to written interrogatories, production of documents, and the deposition of four individuals (one each from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and DOGE), to last no more than eight hours in aggregate.\nUpdate 5: On Feb. 28, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition on Mar. 7.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 11, Defendants filed a motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s prior ruling authorizing written discovery. In an accompanying memorandum, Defendants asserted that changes since the ruling, including the fact that DOGE is no longer detailing employees to any defendant agency, \u201cshould obviate the need for expedited discovery.\u201d\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 13, Plaintiffs filed a motion opposing reconsideration of the ruling authorizing written discovery, asserting that the new employment arrangements do not \u201cmeet the exceedingly high bar\u201d for reconsideration.\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 14, Defendants filed a memorandum supporting their motion to dismiss, reasserting that plaintiffs lack standing and failed to state a claim.\nUpdate 9: On Mar. 19, plaintiffs filed a notice of new evidence, notifying the court of Amy Gleason\u2019s declaration that she is Acting Director of DOGE in Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. U.S. Doge Service, 1:25-cv-00511. Plaintiffs assert that Gleason\u2019s declaration supports their argument in favor of public access to documents surrounding Gleason\u2019s appointment.\nUpdate 10: On Mar. 19, Judge Bates issued a memorandum opinion denying Defendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration.\nUpdate 11: On Mar. 29, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel discovery, including production of documents, written discovery responses, and deposition testimony, relating to actions by members of the DOGE Teams at relevant agencies.\nUpdate 12: On Mar. 31, Defendants filed a response to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel discovery, asserting that the request \u201cis unambiguously outside the scope of\u201d their prior requests and \u201cdoes not relate to any plausible Economy Act issue.\u201d\nUpdate 13: On Mar. 31, Judge Bates issued an order granting Plaintiffs motion to compel discovery regarding \u201cindividuals that the defendant agencies have onboarded for the purpose of carrying out the DOGE agenda,\u201d including direct hires or detailees. The order also extends the deadline for Defendants to respond to the discovery requests.\nUpdate 14: On Apr. 16, Judge Bates issued an order dismissing counts relating to the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, Administrative Procedure Act, Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. \nUpdate 15: On Apr. 19, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent DOGE employees or affiliates from accessing sensitive agency systems and records. \nUpdate 16: On Apr. 29, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the limited discovery that the court granted has not demonstrated that Plaintiffs have suffered irreparable harm.\nUpdate 17: On May 2, Plaintiffs filed a reply supporting their motion for a preliminary injunction, asserting that Defendants\u2019 motion fails to dispute key allegations and misstates or mischaracterizes material facts and law.\nUpdate 18: Judge Bates denied a preliminary injunction seeking to block DOGE-affiliates from accessing sensitive government data at the Department of Labor and HHS. While emphasizing that his concerns about DOGE are \u201cas grave as ever,\u201d Bates concluded that plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm at this stage in the litigation that would justify emergency relief. 2025-06-27\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Disclosure of personal and financial records to DOGEUniversity of California Student Ass\u2019n v. Carter et al\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00354\n\nCASE CLOSEDComplaint2025-02-07Overview: The University of California Student Association sued the Department of Education seeking to block the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s (\u201cDOGE\u2019s\u201d) access to sensitive information systems containing student data on the basis that such access violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the Privacy Act, and the Internal Revenue Code. A federal court denied the request to temporarily block DOGE\u2019s access while the case proceeds.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 3, 2025, reportedly 20 people affiliated with DOGE were working with the Department of Education, some of whom obtained access to sensitive internal information systems, including systems related to federal student aid. Plaintiffs sued, arguing DOGE\u2019s access is unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act in that it is contrary to law in violation of the Privacy Act and Internal Revenue Code; arbitrary and capricious; and in excess of statutory authority. They seek a declaratory judgment that DOGE officials are not authorized to access Department of Education records that contain personal information, and temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief preventing the Department of Education from continuing to provide access to DOGE, ensuring there is no further dissemination of data, and requiring recovery of unlawfully transferred information.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 10, Plaintiff moved for a TRO, requesting Defendants be enjoined from disclosing information about individuals to individuals affiliated with DOGE, and required to retrieve and safeguard any such information that has already been obtained by and shared or transferred by DOGE or individuals associated with it.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 17, Judge Randolph Moss denied the TRO on the grounds that mere \u201caccess\u201d to data by government employees who are not formally authorized to view it, without more, does not create an irreparable injury. He wrote that courts find dissemination of information to be an irreparable injury where highly sensitive information will be made public or is given to someone with no obligation to keep it confidential. He also wrote that irreparable harm was not present because plaintiffs would have a private right of action and money damages for certain unauthorized disclosures.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 4, plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited discovery.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 18, Judge Moss denied Plaintiff\u2019s motion for expedited discovery, instead ordering that Defendant promptly produce the relevant administrative record while noting that Plaintiff may renew their motion after the record has been received and reviewed.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 8, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that Plaintiffs lack standing and have not suffered a cognizable injury under the APA.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 16, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action.2025-04-16\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Disclosure of personal and financial records to DOGENational Treasury Employees Union v.

On February 7, 2025, Chris Young, Nikhil Rajpul, and Gavin Kliger\u2014none of whom is or has been a CFPB employee\u2014were added to CFPB\u2019s staff and email directories as \u201csenior advisers.\u201d Russell Vought, as Acting Director of CFPB, instructed CFPB staffers to grant this DOGE team access to all non-classified systems. Plaintiffs maintain that CFPB has a statutory obligation to protect its employee information under both the Privacy Act and CFPB regulations (5 C.F.R. Part 1070). Plaintiffs claim that CFPB violated that obligation by granting DOGE access to employee information without satisfying an exception in the Privacy Act. Plaintiffs seek a judgment declaring that CFPB violated the law by granting DOGE access to CFPB systems, that CFPB\u2019s  disclosure of employee information to DOGE is unlawful, and request an injunction to prevent CFPB from disclosing employee records to DOGE.2025-02-09\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Disclosure of personal and financial records to DOGEAmerican Federation of Teachers et al v.

The plaintiffs argue that the disclosure violates federal law and goes beyond the agencies\u2019 scope of authority. They have asked the court to declare the disclosure unlawful, to temporarily and permanently stop the agencies from further sharing information, and to require the agencies retrieve the information disclosed. The court has stopped DOE and OPM from disclosing information with DOGE, while Treasury has also been stopped from disclosure by a separate but related case. \nCase Summary: The complaint alleges that the Treasury Department, Office of Personnel Management, and Department of Education have provided DOGE \u201cspecial government employees\u201d with access to information systems that contain records of private citizens' sensitive personal information (including Social Security numbers, financial records, and more). Plaintiffs sued, arguing DOGE access is unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act as (1) not in accordance with the Privacy Act; (2) an arbitrary and capricious abuse of discretion; and (3) in excess of statutory authority. They seek a declaratory judgment that disclosing records to DOGE is unlawful and temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief to bar defendants from allowing DOGE to access sensitive information; ensure there is no further unauthorized disclosure; ensure records improperly disseminated are retrieved or destroyed; and ensure future disclosures will only occur in accordance with the Privacy Act.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 12, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO enjoining Defendants from providing DOGE access to their records systems and ordering any records housed outside government information systems be retrieved or destroyed.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 24, the court granted a TRO enjoining the Department of Education and Office of Personnel Management from disclosing sensitive information to any DOGE affiliates. The court denied the motion for a TRO against Treasury officials on the basis that a preliminary injunction against Treasury has already been granted in a related case.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 27, Judge Deborah Boardman ordered the government to produce the administrative record by Mar. 7. \nUpdate 4: On Mar. 7 the government submitted records from OPM, the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Education.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 8, Plaintiffs filed a motion to convert the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction and to schedule discovery in the case.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 8, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent Defendants from disclosing personally identifiable information to DOGE or its affiliates.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 24, Judge Deborah L.

U.S. Office of Personnel Management (E.D.V.A.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00255Complaint2025-02-10Overview: The Electronic Privacy Information Center (\u201cEPIC\u201d) and a federal employee sued the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) and the Treasury Department, challenging the agencies\u2019 disclosure of sensitive personal information to Department of Government Efficiency (\u201cDOGE\u201d) employees. The plaintiffs argue that the disclosure violates federal law, violates their constitutional rights, puts them at risk of identity theft, and goes beyond the agencies\u2019 scope of authority. They have asked the court to declare the disclosures unlawful and stop the agencies from sharing and accessing the information. The court denied their request to block DOGE\u2019s access because the possible scenarios for harm were too speculative.  \nCase Summary: The complaint alleges that the Treasury Department granted DOGE-affiliated individuals access to sensitive personal and financial information maintained by the Treasury Department. The plaintiffs, Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and Doe 1 (a federal employee), sued, claiming that the transmission of these records violated the plaintiffs\u2019 right to privacy and puts plaintiffs at risk of identity theft and financial crimes. Plaintiffs also argue that the transmission of these records was not compliant with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) and other privacy and security requirements. The lawsuit seeks injunctive and declaratory relief curing the release of information and halting further sharing by OPM and Treasury, alleging violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, Privacy Act, the Fifth Amendment, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103, and actions beyond the scope of authority\u2014primarily by the DOGE defendants. Doe 1 also seeks an award of statutory and punitive damages. \nUpdate 1: On Feb. 12, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO to enjoin Treasury and OPM defendants from providing DOGE access to information systems, to  enjoin DOGE defendants from accessing information systems, and to require status reports.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 21, Judge Rossie D. Alston, Jr. issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order converting the motion for a TRO to a motion for a preliminary injunction, and denying the motion. Judge Alston wrote, \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 fears of future harm are much too speculative and would require the Court to make several leaps in reasoning in order to warrant injunctive relief\u201d based on the record before the court. The judge stated: \u201cAlthough the Court is denying injunctive relief based on the current record, Plaintiffs are permitted to take necessary action to protect their rights if, in the future, they experience harm that is more concrete and immediate, including if Plaintiffs are able to provide evidence that unauthorized personnel accessed the BFS and/or EHRI systems.\u201d\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 15, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the Plaintiffs lack subject matter jurisdiction, or in the alternative, fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\nUpdate 4: On May 6, Plaintiffs amended their complaint, removing their FISMA claim under the APA and adding APA claims against the Defendant Agencies for actions that are contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and in violation of the APA\u2019s notice and comment procedures.2025-05-06\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Disclosure of personal and financial records to DOGEAmerican Federation of Government Employees, et al. v. Office of Personnel Management et al  (S.D.N.Y)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01237Complaint2025-02-11Overview: The American Federation of Government Employees and other plaintiffs sued the Office of Personnel Management (\u201dOPM\u201d), challenging the agencies\u2019  alleging unlawful disclosure of sensitive personal information to Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employees. The plaintiffs argue that the disclosure violates federal laws under the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and goes beyond the agencies\u2019 scope of authority. They have asked the court to declare the disclosure unlawful, stop the agencies from further sharing information, and require the agencies retrieve and destroy the information disclosed. The court has since dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 Privacy Act claims but is allowing the APA and action beyond the scope of agency authority claims to proceed. The court has blocked OPM from continuing to share federal employee records to DOGE employees. \nCase Summary: Plaintiffs allege the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has given DOGE access to OPM information systems that contain sensitive personal and employment records of government employees (including Social Security numbers, demographic information, job performance information, health records, and more). Plaintiffs, current and former federal employees and unions representing them, sued, arguing OPM\u2019s disclosure of this information to DOGE violates the Privacy Act and the Administrative Procedure Act; and that DOGE\u2019s actions are ultra vires. They seek a declaratory judgment that the government\u2019s actions are unlawful; temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief; and an order for the impoundment and destruction of copies of improperly disclosed personal information.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 14, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order. On Feb. 19, defendants filed a memorandum in opposition. On Feb. 23, in light of a TRO issued by the District of Maryland in Am. Fed. of Teachers v. Bessent, plaintiffs joined defendants in requesting that their motion for a TRO be converted to a motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 27, plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited discovery. Defendants filed a memorandum in opposition on Mar. 4. Plaintiffs filed a reply on Mar. 6. Judge Cote granted the motion in part on Mar. 7.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 24, plaintiffs filed a memorandum opposing the government\u2019s motion to dismiss.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 31, Defendants filed their Reply Memorandum in Further Support of Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss, in which they argue that Plaintiffs do not have standing, that Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint failed to state Privacy Act or ultra vires claims, and that Plaintiffs\u2019 APA claims are not reviewable because they did not challenge a final agency action and Plaintiffs have another adequate legal remedy under the Privacy Act.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 3, Judge Denise Cote denied the government\u2019s motion to dismiss in part and granted it in part with respect to some claims.  Judge Cote held that the Plaintiffs have standing to bring their claims and denied the government\u2019s motion to dismiss with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 APA and ultra vires claims. Judge Cote granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 two Privacy Act claims because injunctive relief is not available as a remedy for the alleged Privacy Act violations.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 17, the Defendants filed an answer in response to the Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, responding paragraph-by-paragraph to the complaint and listing six defenses, including that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the complaint fails to state a claim for which relief may be granted, and that the Defendants did not act contrary to, or in violation of, any federal law.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 25, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in which it requests that the Court block OPM from disclosing records to DOGE and allowing Defendants access to personal information contained within these records. In its supporting memorandum, Plaintiffs noted a preliminary injunction is necessary to prevent the Defendants from causing further harm through their misuse of data.\nUpdate 8: On May 15, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction motion, arguing Plaintiffs\u2019 submissions in support of their motion rely on inadmissible evidence.\nUpdate 9: On June 9, Judge Cote temporarily blocked the Office of Personnel Management from continuing to share federal employee records with individuals tied to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The court cited questions about whether the data-sharing violates the Privacy Act, violates OPM\u2019s internal privacy safeguards, and risks irreparable harm to employees\u2019 personal data.\nUpdate 10: On June 20, in connection with the June 9 preliminary injunction order, Judge Cote ordered OPM to file a report within two weeks describing the procedures put in place since Mar. 6, 2025, to ensure adherence to the requirements of the Privacy Act with respect to new grant of access permissions by OPM to records containing plaintiffs\u2019 personally identifiable information (PII). Judge Cote also ordered OPM to file a report within four weeks concerning OPM\u2019s grant of access permissions to any records containing plaintiffs\u2019 PII made to DOGE personnel.2025-06-20\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Disclosure of personal and financial records to DOGENemeth-Greenleaf, et al. v.

The plaintiffs argue the disclosure violates federal laws. They have asked the court to stop further disclosure and for compensation for harm.  \nCase Summary: Plaintiffs are federal employees from various government departments who filed suit as a proposed class action. They allege that DOGE workers without proper security clearance or authorization to handle such personal information unlawfully accessed their private information from OPM and the Treasury Department. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants are engaged in an \u201cunlawful ongoing, systemic, and continuous disclosure of personal, health, and financial information\u201d to Elon Musk and DOGE in violation of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a. They seek injunctive relief and damages.\nUpdate 1: On June 30, the Plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint outlining subsequent events since the initial complaint was filed, including allegations that named plaintiffs\u2019 data stored with the OPM was leaked on the dark web and reports that the personal data taken by DOGE workers had been used by hackers, endangering national security.2025-06-30\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Disclosure of personal and financial records to DOGEGribbon et al. v.

The plaintiffs argue that by sharing their private information, Musk and the agencies violated federal laws. The plaintiffs have asked the court to declare Musk and the agencies\u2019 actions unlawful, stop them from further sharing the plaintiffs\u2019 information, and require them to provide lifetime identity theft and fraud protection services. \nCase Summary: Plaintiffs filed a proposed class action lawsuit. They are recipients of federal benefits, student loans, or have filed tax return information with the federal government. The complaint alleges that \u201cDefendants [are] liable for their willful failure to ensure the security of Plaintiffs\u2019 and Class members\u2019\u201d private information. Plaintiffs allege Defendant Elon Musk violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and that Defendants OPM and Treasury violated the Privacy Act of 1974. Plaintiffs are suing for injunctive relief and monetary damages \u201cresulting from Defendants\u2019 unlawful ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure of personal and financial information.\u201d\nUpdate 1: On May 15, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action.2025-05-15\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Disclosure of personal and financial records to DOGECenter for Taxpayer Rights v.

The plaintiffs argue that by allowing DOGE\u2019s access, the agencies violated multiple federal laws and exceeded their scope of authority. The plaintiffs have asked the court to declare the access unlawful, stop DOGE\u2019s access, and require the return or deletion of the shared information. The defendants have moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. \nCase Summary: Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s access to information from the Internal Revenue Service. Plaintiffs are organizations that represent low-income taxpayers, immigrants, domestic abuse survivors, small businesses, and public and private sector employees. They allege that by allowing DOGE to access private citizens\u2019 tax information, the IRS has violated the Federal Information Security Act, the Privacy Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs also allege that DOGE has engaged in \u201cultra vires\u201d actions by \u201cdirecting and controlling the use and administration of Defendant IRS\u2019 systems.\u201d They seek declaratory and injunctive relief to stop allegedly \u201cwrongful provision of access, inspection, and disclosure of return information and other personal information in the IRS system to members of DOGE.\u201d They also seek other forms of relief such as ordering Defendants to disgorge all unlawfully obtained information.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 25, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim for which relief can be granted. Defendants\u2019 memorandum of law in support of this motion asserts that Plaintiffs lack both associational and organizational standing to bring their claims and that the intent of Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint is to interfere with IRS operations.\nUpdate 2: On May 16, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.2025-05-16\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Disclosure of personal and financial records to DOGEAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO v.

Md.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00596Complaint2025-02-21Overview: Three labor unions sued the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) and the Department of Government Efficiency (\u201cDOGE\u201d), challenging the access to sensitive personal data of millions of Americans which SSA gave to DOGE. The unions argue that the access violates multiple federal laws and the Constitution. The unions have asked the court to declare DOGE\u2019s access to SSA data unlawful, require DOGE return to delete the data, and stop any further sharing of information and access. The government attempted to appeal this temporary block, but their appeal was denied by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. On Jun. 6, the Supreme Court ruled that DOGE may have access to sensitive records at the SSA while litigation proceeds. \nCase Summary: Plaintiffs filed a lawsuit challenging the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s access to Social Security Administration data and systems. They allege that allowing DOGE to access private citizens\u2019 sensitive data violates several laws, including the Internal Revenue Code, the Privacy Act, the Federal Information Systems Modernization Act, the E-Government Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. They further allege that Acting SSA Commissioner Leland Dudek\u2019s exercise of significant authority without nomination or confirmation violates the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Plaintiffs ask the court to declare DOGE\u2019s access to SSA data and systems unlawful, order DOGE to disgorge or delete any unlawfully obtained data, and prohibit any further efforts by either DOGE or SSA to enable DOGE to access SSA data or systems.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 7, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 7, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and/or stay.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 20, Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander granted a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 21, Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander issued two Letters to Counsel clarifying the scope of the temporary restraining order in the face of reporting that Acting SSA Commissioner Dudek claimed that the TRO required terminating all SSA employees\u2019 access to SSA systems. The first letter clarifies that the TRO applies only to the 10 DOGE employees the government said were \u201cassigned to SSA to further the DOGE agenda.\u201d The second letter clarifies that other SSA employees are not subject to the TRO, and that SSA may \u201cprovide access to redacted or anonymized data or records to the DOGE Team, subject to proper training and the like,\u201d as well as non-anonymized data \u201csubject to certain conditions.\u201d\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 24, Defendants filed a notice to appeal the TRO.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 1, the Fourth Circuit denied the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. A corrected order denying the appeal was filed on Apr. 2.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 4, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunctions and/or U.S.C. Section 705 stay, with the goal of enjoining past and future access to any SSA system of record of PII. \nUpdate 8: On Apr. 7, the defendants filed their opposition to the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and/or stay, challenging the validity of the plaintiff\u2019s standing as well as their allegations of violations of the Privacy Act or the Internal Revenue Code, ultimately refuting plaintiff\u2019s allegations of irreparable harm.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 17, Judge Hollander granted the preliminary injunction. \nOn that same day, Defendants appealed this order to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nUpdate 10: On Apr. 17, Defendants also filed a motion requesting to stay the preliminary injunction pending appeal, on the basis that the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals had also granted a stay of the preliminary injunction in the substantively similar case American Federation of Teachers v. Bessent. Plaintiffs filed their opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to stay the preliminary injunction on Apr. 19. On Apr. 22, Judge Hollander denied Defendants\u2019 motion to stay the preliminary injunction, on the basis that the Fourth Circuit may not schedule the appeal hearing until fall of 2025 and that Plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm if DOGE were able to access Plaintiffs\u2019 personal data while awaiting appeal.\nUpdate 11: On Apr. 20, the Fourth Circuit granted an initial en banc hearing (a hearing with all the judges of the court instead of the standard three-judge panel) and denied Defendants\u2019 motion to stay in a split decision.\nUpdate 12: On May 6, the Fourth Circuit granted an en banc hearing on the merits.\nUpdate 13: On Jun. 6, the Supreme Court granted a stay while the case is on appeal.\n2025-06-06\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Disclosure of personal and financial records to DOGEACLU v.

They requested expedited processing and a waiver of fees under 5 USC \u00a7552 (a)(6)(E)(v)(II) on the ground that there is \u201can urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity\u201d and that the request is \u201cmade by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information\u201d. \nAlthough other agencies complied with the request, on Feb. 13 the SSA denied the request for expedited processing and fee waiver and subsequently failed to respond to an appeal filed by the ACLU on March 24. The VA failed to act on the request altogether.\nOn April 21, Plaintiff sued under FOIA to compel the immediate expedited processing and disclosure of the requested records and requesting an injunction against the imposition of any charges in connection with their request.\nUpdate 1: On May 7, the Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction and supporting memorandum, claiming that they are likely to succeed on the merits and will suffer irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction, and the balance of equities and the public interest weigh in favor of granting relief.\nUpdate 2: On June 19, the Defendant Agencies answered Plaintiff\u2019s complaint. These agencies admitted that they failed to respond to Plaintiff\u2019s FOIA request, but provided several defenses to Plaintiff\u2019s action, including alleging Plaintiff is not entitled to compel the production of records under FOIA, the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff\u2019s requests, and that they did not improperly withhold the records Plaintiff requested under FOIA.2025-06-19\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Disclosure of personal and financial records to DOGEPallek v.

Trump signed Executive Order (EO) 14243, titled \u201cStopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos,\u201d which calls on agencies to ensure \u201cunfettered access to comprehensive data from all State programs\u201d in furtherance of the Administration\u2019s goals. Pursuant to this EO, the USDA sought to obtain data from States and their authorized vendors about applicants to and recipients of benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a nutrition assistance program available to low-income households that operates as a federal-state partnership. Two not-for-profit organisations,  Mazon, Inc., an anti-hunger advocacy group, and Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), along with four individuals who receive SNAP benefits, filed suit on May 22, 2025, claiming that by initiating the collection of personal information of tens of millions of SNAP applicants and recipients the Defendants violated the Privacy Act, the E-Government Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act, by failing to provide information and follow procedural requirements set out in these statutes. The complaint alleges that these actions violate the APA as agency actions not in accordance with law, as well as the APA\u2019s \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard, The Plaintiffs requested a declaration from the court that USDA had acted unlawfully by collecting information from SNAP applicants and sought temporary and permanent injunctive relief to protect the privacy and security of information collected by Defendants. \nUpdate 1: On May 27, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for an emergency temporary restraining order to enjoin Defendants from retrieving any SNAP applicant and recipient information from State governments, and directing Defendants to destroy any information that had already been transferred. \nUpdate 2: On May 20, 2025, Defendants filed a memorandum in opposition to the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order. \nUpdate 3: On June 2, 2025, Plaintiffs withdrew their motion for a temporary restraining order following representations from Defendants concerning procedural steps it would be taking before seeking the data. 2025-06-02\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: \u201cFork Directive\u201d deferred resignation offer to federal employees (OPM Directive)American Federation of Gov\u2019t Employees, AFL-CIO v. Ezell (D. Mass)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-10276Complaint2025-02-04Overview: Multiple labor unions sued the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d), challenging the legality of the \"deferred resignation\" offer program. The offer, sent to nearly all federal employees, gives them the option to receive compensation until September 30, 2025 if they resign by February 6, 2025, where the unions say the implied alternative is earlier termination. The unions argue that the program violates the Constitution and federal laws. The unions have asked the court to declare the program unlawful, void the program, and immediately and permanently suspend the February 6 deadline. The court initially suspended the deadline until the court heard arguments from both sides; however, shortly after, the court removed the suspension and denied the unions\u2019 requests on the basis that they had not followed correct procedures in filing the suit.  \nCase Summary: On January 28, 2025, the Office of Personnel Management sent an email to career federal employees presenting what it described as a deferred resignation program, an offer to receive compensation until September 30, 2025 if they resign now (\u201cFork Directive\u201d email). A deadline for the offer was set for February 6, 2025. Plaintiffs filed suit, arguing the directive violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it is \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and not in accordance with the Antideficiency Act. They seek a declaratory judgment that the directive violates the APA and that the directive be vacated; they also seek an preliminary and permanent injunction of the February 6, 2025 deadline and an order that OPM submit for court approval a corrected communication for all employees who received the directive.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 5, 2025, the plaintiffs requested a temporary restraining order and that within 24 hours of the TRO, the Government provide written notice of the TRO to all federal employees who have received the directive.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 6, 2025, Judge George O\u2019Toole issued an order to pause the program and extend the deadline until Monday when a hearing is scheduled.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 10, 2025, Judge O\u2019Toole ordered that the stay of the Feb. 6 deadline will remain in effect \u201cpending the completion of briefing and oral argument on the issues.\u201d Defendants notified the Court of their compliance with the order.\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 12, 2025, Judge O\u2019Toole dissolved the TRO and denied further preliminary injunctive relief, finding that the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing and that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the claims asserted.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 31, Plaintiffs amended their complaint to include additional factual allegations and additional Administrative Procedure Act and ultra vires claims related to the Fork Directive deferred resignation program and OPM\u2019s implementation of it. \nUpdate 6: On May 8, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, disputing the Court\u2019s subject-matter jurisdiction and arguing that the APA and ultra vires claims are barred.2025-05-08\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Removal of independent agency leadersGwynne A.

Cir.)\n\nCase No. 25-5057\n\nCourt below: D.D.C.\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00334 Complaint 2025-02-05Overview: Gwynne Wilcox (a member of the National Labor Relations Board) sued President Donald Trump challenging her removal from the National Labor Relations Board as a violation of the National Labor Relations Act, claiming that Trump did not meet the standard required for Wilcox\u2019s removal under federal law and that Wilcox was not given notice and a hearing to contest her removal. Judge Beryl Howell ruled in favor of Wilcox, holding she was unlawfully removed from office. A full bench of the DC Circuit had left the district court\u2019s ruling in place while the case is being appealed. But the Supreme Court has placed a hold on the district court and DC Circuit orders pending appeal. \nCase Summary: This case challenges President Trump\u2019s removal of Gwynne A. Wilcox from her position on the National Labor Relations Board.  The suit alleges the removal is in violation of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.), which allows the president to remove Board members only in cases of neglect of duty or malfeasance and only after notice and hearing. The Plaintiff is seeking relief under the Declaratory Judgement Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 2202, to establish that she remains a rightful member of the Board and that the President lacks authority to remove her. She also seeks an injunction against the Chairman of the National Labor Relations Board, who oversaw the termination.  \nUpdate 1: On Feb. 10, Plaintiff moved for expedited summary judgment.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 21, the government filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing statutory restrictions protecting NLRB members unconstitutionally conflict with the President\u2019s Article II powers.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 6, Judge Beryl Howell granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and denied the defendant's cross motion for summary judgment. The court issued a declaratory judgment that Wilcox\u2019s firing was unlawful and that she remains a member of the NLRB; the court further ordered that Wilcox be allowed to continue to serve in office unless removed for cause under the NLRA, and enjoined defendants from removing Wilcox or impeding her from executing her duties.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 7, defendants appealed to the D.C. Circuit (Case No. 25-5057) and requested the district court issue a stay pending appeal. On Mar. 8, Judge Howell denied the motion to stay.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 10, the government filed an emergency motion with the D.C. Circuit to stay the district court\u2019s judgment pending appeal. On Mar. 11, Wilcox filed her response. On Mar. 13, the government filed a reply. \nUpdate 6: On Mar. 28, the D.C. Circuit, in a 2-1 decision, granted the Defendants\u2019 motion to stay the district court decision pending appeal. \nUpdate 7: On Mar. 28, as well the Plaintiff submitted a notice of intent to petition for an en banc hearing, and to stay the order.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 7, the D.C. Circuit, in a 7-4, en banc decision reinstated the district court's order.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 9, the Defendants petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay, and the Court, per Chief Justice Roberts, issued a stay and ordered the plaintiffs to respond by Apr. 15, which they did.\nUpdate 10: On Apr. 7, Wilcox filed an appellate brief, arguing that the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiff should be upheld. Wilcox reiterates her argument that the President does not have the authority to remove members of the NLRB without cause. Wilcox also challenges the government\u2019s argument that the District Court does not have the right to grant injunctive relief.  \nUpdate 11: On Apr. 11, the Defendants filed a reply brief, arguing that the President has constitutional authority to remove members of the NLRB and MSPB at will and that the District Courts erred in ordering the reinstatement of the officers the President had already removed.\nUpdate 12: On May 22, the Supreme Court granted the government\u2019s request for a stay while the case is on appeal.2025-05-22\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Removal of independent agency leadersCathy A.

Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d), sued President Donald Trump for firing her from the MSPB without cause in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Harris asked the court to allow her to continue in her position while the lawsuit proceeds and to declare her removal unlawful. A federal court agreed Harris could remain in her role while the case is pending, ruling that Trump likely did not meet the standard required for her removal under applicable law. Trump appealed this ruling. A full bench of the DC Circuit had left the district court\u2019s ruling in place while the case is being appealed. But the Supreme Court has placed a hold on the district court and DC Circuit orders pending appeal. \nCase Summary: Plaintiff Cathy A. Harris challenges her removal from the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), an independent federal agency.  Plaintiff alleges that she received a one-sentence email from Trent Morse, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, stating that Plaintiff had been terminated, effective immediately.  Plaintiff, whose term on the MSPB was set to expire in 2028, alleges that she was unlawfully removed from her position without justification, despite the statutory requirement that MSPB members may only be removed for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d She alleges the action was ultra vires and violated the Administrative Procedure Act. She seeks a declaratory judgment and injunction as well as an emergency temporary restraining order to reinstate her position on the MSPB.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 11, Plaintiff moved for a temporary restraining order declaring that her removal is unlawful and that she is a member of the MSPB, and enjoining obstructing her access to the office.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 18, Judge Rudolph Contreras granted the temporary restraining order and ordered that Harris continue to serve as Chair of the MSPB until the court rules on a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 4, Judge Contreras granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court issued a declaratory judgment that Harris remains a member of the MSPB and that she may be removed by the President prior to the expiration of her term only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. The court also enjoined defendants from removing Harris from office without cause.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 4, the government appealed to the D.C. Circuit and moved that the district court stay its order pending appeal.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 5, the district court denied the government\u2019s motion to stay its order pending appeal.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 6, the government filed an emergency motion with the D.C.

Circuit Case No. 25-5165Complaint2025-02-13Overview: Susan Grundmann (former Chair of the Federal Labor Relations Authority) sued President Donald Trump challenging her removal from the National Labor Relations Authority as a violation of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, claiming that Trump did not meet the standard required for Grundmann\u2019s removal under federal law and that Grundmann was not given notice and a hearing to contest her removal. A federal judge has ruled that her removal was unlawful and ordered her to be reinstated. That order is temporarily stayed while the decision is on appeal. \nCase Summary: On Feb, 10, 2025, White House official Trent Morse sent a two-sentence email to Susan Grundmann stating that her position on the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), an independent agency, \u201cis terminated, effective immediately.\u201d\nPlaintiff Susan Grundmann challenges her removal from the FLRA. Plaintiff was Chair of the FLRA when she received the email from Morse, Deputy Director of the White House Office of Presidential Personnel. Plaintiff alleges she was improperly removed in violation of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7104), which states that \u201cMembers of the Authority\u2026may be removed by the President only upon notice and hearing and only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief and an injunction ordering her reinstatement. \nUpdate 1: On Feb. 14, Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction and summary judgment.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 25, defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgement and memorandum in opposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 12, Judge Sparkle Sooknanan granted Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that her termination was unlawful and granting a permanent injunction reinstating her authority. \nUpdate 4: On May 8, Defendants appealed Judge Sooknanan\u2019s Mar. 12 order granting Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment to the D.C.

Bessent (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ\n\nCASE CLOSEDComplaint2025-02-10Overview: Hampton Dellinger, Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, sued President Donald Trump for firing him without cause in violation of a statute saying he may only be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. A federal judge allowed him to resume his position while the case proceeded through the courts. The Supreme Court rejected the government\u2019s appeal of this decision on February 21. On March 5, 2025, the DC Circuit Court issued a 3-0 decision that effectively removed Dellinger from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, and the following day Dellinger dropped his case. \nCase Summary: Plaintiff Hampton Dellinger has been the Special Counsel in the Office of the Special Counsel (OSC) since Mar. 6, 2024, when he was nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a five-year term. The OSC is an independent federal agency founded by Congress as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. Its primary function is to protect federal employees and others who come forward as whistleblowers. Once confirmed, the Special Counsel serves a five-year term and \u201cmay be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d On Feb. 7, 2025, Dellinger received a two-sentence email from Sergio Gor, informing Dellinger that he was terminated, effective immediately, and stating no cause for such termination. Dellinger is suing under six different counts and seeks a declaratory judgment that President Trump\u2019s decision to fire him was unlawful, that the Special Counsel may only be removed for cause; and seeks an order that Dellinger may not be removed and is entitled to backpay. As precedent for the constitutionality of the statutory for-cause protection, Dellinger cites to Humphrey\u2019s Executor.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 10, 2025, Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued an administrative stay on Dellinger\u2019s termination through midnight on February 13, 2025, while the parties submit their briefs.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 11, 2025, defendants appealed to the D.C. Circuit (case no. 25-5025), making an emergency motion to stay the district court\u2019s administrative stay. \nUpdate 3: On Feb. 12, 2025, the D.C. Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 12, 2025, Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the D.C. District Court granted a temporary restraining order, ordering that Dellinger shall continue to serve as Special Counsel and prohibiting defendants from denying him the resources and materials of his office.\nUpdate 5: On Feb. 13, Defendants filed an appeal to the D.C. Circuit (case no. 25-5028). In the District Court, their motion for a stay pending appeal was denied.\nUpdate 6: On Feb. 15, the D.C. Circuit rejected the Defendant\u2019s appeal in a 2-1 opinion. \nUpdate 7: The Government petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court asking the Justices to freeze and vacate the district court order that had temporarily reinstated Dellinger.\nUpdate 8: On Feb. 21, the Supreme Court rejected (7-2) the Government\u2019s petition on the ground that a TRO was not properly subject to appeal at this stage.\nUpdate 9: On Feb. 26, Judge Jackson extended the TRO ordering that Dellinger remain as Special Counsel for an additional three days until she \u201ccomplete[s] the written opinion on the consolidated motion for preliminary injunction and cross motions for summary judgment\u201d (indicating she will rule on that day, Mar. 1).\nUpdate 10: On Mar. 1, Judge Jackson issued an Opinion and Order in favor of the Plaintiff. The Defendants immediately appealed to the DC Circuit.\nUpdate 11: On Mar. 5, the DC Circuit in a 3-0 decision put a halt to the district court order pending the appeal. \u201cThis order gives effect to the removal of [Dellinger] from his position as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\u201d the DC Circuit wrote.\nUpdate 12: On Mar. 6, Dellinger announced that he was dropping his case.2025-03-05\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Removal of independent agency leadersLeBlanc & Felten v. United States Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00542Complaint2025-02-24Overview: After all three Democratic members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (\u201cPCLOB\u201d) were removed by the PCLOB, two of them sued to challenge their removal. By law, the PCLOB is required to have members from both Democrat and Republican parties. The plaintiffs argue that they were dismissed unlawfully on the basis of their political affiliation and not for good cause. They have asked the court to declare that the Board does not have the authority to remove them purely for political reasons, and to void the removals as unlawful. They have also asked the court to require the PCLOB (aside from the President) to reinstate and stop the PCLOB (aside from the President) from future removals not based on good cause. Both sides have asked the court to enter a summary judgment for this case. The district court ruled against the President's action. \nCase Summary: On Jan, 27, 2025, the U.S. Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) purported to remove Plaintiffs, two Senate-confirmed members of the Board. Plaintiffs represent two out of three Democratic members of the Board, which is required by statute to have Democratic and Republican members.\nPlaintiffs allege that the text, structure, and function of the 9/11 Commission Act bars removal of PCLOB members without good cause. They also assert that by removing Board members solely on the basis of their political affiliation, defendants have acted \u201cnot in accordance with law.\u201d They seek a declaration that the Defendants \u201chave no authority\u201d to remove Plaintiffs from the Board based on their political affiliation and for the court to \u201chold unlawful and set aside the purported removals.\u201d They also seek an injunction prohibiting defendants (other than the President) from removing them from their positions without good cause and enjoin defendants (other than the President) to restore them to those positions.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 12, Plaintiffs amended their complaint. No new claims were added in the amended complaint, however Plaintiffs included a request for an award of backpay of up to $10,000 from the date of the unlawful removals to their prayer for relief.\nOn that same day, Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment, memorandum in support, and statement of undisputed facts. Plaintiffs note that Congress revised the PCLOB statute in 2007 to secure the Board\u2019s independence from Presidential control.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 3, Defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgment and opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and memorandum in support in which they assert Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are without merit.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 16, Plaintiffs filed a response to Defendants\u2019 cross-motion to the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and reply in support of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In this response, Plaintiffs argue that Defendants incorrectly interpreted the PCLOB statute to allow the President to freely fire PCLOB members without cause. The next day, Plaintiffs filed their response to Defendants\u2019 opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 23, Defendants replied in further support of their cross-motion for summary judgment. Defendants argue that President Trump lawfully removed Plaintiffs from PCLOB because the text in PCLOB\u2019s statute does not limit the President\u2019s presumptive removal authority.\nUpdate 5: On May 21, Judge Reggie Whalton issued a summary judgment for the Plaintiffs along with a memorandum opinion.\nUpdate 6: On May 27, Defendants appealed Judge Whalton\u2019s summary judgment order to the D.C. Circuit.2025-05-27\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Removal of independent agency leadersAviel v. Gor et al (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00778Complaint2025-03-17Overview:On Mar. 17, the President and CEO of the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) sued several federal officials and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) involved in her purported termination from her position at the IAF. She has asked the court to order that she cannot be removed from her role on the basis that her removal violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the Inter-American Foundation Act, and the Constitution. The district court has provisionally ordered that Aviel cannot be removed from her position, however the federal officials and DOGE have appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 19, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order titled \u201cCommencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,\u201d which mandated the reduction of the size of the federal government and listed the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) as a covered entity. After her purported removal as President and CEO of the IAF, Plaintiff Sara Aviel filed suit against the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and several federal officials, including Trump and Pete Marocco, the Acting Deputy Administrator for Policy and Planning and for Management Resources for USAID and Director of Foreign Assistance at the U.S. Department of State. Plaintiff alleges that she was unlawfully terminated because she can only be removed by the IAF\u2019s Board of Directors and not by Trump. The Plaintiff also alleges that Trump did not follow the required process when he appointed Marocco as acting Chair of the IAF Board without advice and consent of the Senate. Plaintiff requests the Court to enter a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering that she may not be removed from her office as President and CEO of the IAF, that Defendants may not appoint Marocco or any other person as an acting member of the IAF Board or the IAF President and CEO. Plaintiff also requests the Court to declare that she lawfully remains the President and CEO of the IAF and that Marocco has not been lawfully appointed as an acting member of the IAF Board and the President of the IAF.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 17, Plaintiff filed a motion for an immediate administrative stay, temporary restraining order (TRO), and preliminary injunction. Plaintiff has requested that the Court orders that she should not be removed as President of the IAF, that Defendants may not appoint any Board members without going through the proper legal process, and declaring void any actions by Defendants purporting to act as a member of the Board of the IAF. \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 26, Defendants filed a motion opposing Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a TRO and injunction and asserting that Plaintiff should be made to post security for costs sustained by Defendants in connection with any injunctive relief in case Defendants are later found to have been wrongfully enjoined.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 31, Plaintiff filed a reply motion supporting their motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 4: On Apr. 4, Judge Loren Alikhan granted a preliminary injunction, stopping the removal of Aviel from her position as president and CEO of IAF, and enjoining Peter Marocco from serving as an \"acting\" Board member or anyone else without Senate confirmation. The court ordered a status report on or before Apr. 7.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 6, Defendants appealed the Apr. 4 order granting the preliminary injunction to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 18, Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment.\nUpdate 7: On May 7, Defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and opposition to the Plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The filing argued that Aviel was lawfully removed from her position and is not entitled to equitable relief. \nUpdate 8: On May 14, Plaintiff filed a consolidated reply in support of their motion for summary judgment and opposition to Defendants\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment.2025-05-14\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Removal of independent agency leadersSlaughter and Bedoya v. Trump (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00909Complaint2025-03-27Overview: Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, two Democratic Commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) who were recently terminated by President Trump, have sued Trump and the Republican Commissioners and Executive Director of the FTC alleging that their removal was unconstitutional and unlawful because it was not the result of  \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d They have also asked the court to order the Republican Commissioners and Executive Director to treat them as FTC Commissioners.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 18, Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, two Democratic Commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), received a message from President Donald Trump announcing they were being removed from their positions as FTC Commissioners effective immediately on the basis that their \u201ccontinued service on the FTC is inconsistent with [Trump\u2019s] Administration's priorities.\u201d\nSlaughter and Bedoya have sued Trump, as well as the Republican Commissioners of the FTC, Andrew Ferguson and Melissa Holyoak, and the FTC\u2019s Executive Director, David Robbins, on the basis that such a removal violates the FTC Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the separation of powers doctrine. Plaintiffs are asking the court to declare Trump\u2019s termination unlawful because it was not undertaken based on \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office\u201d and to enter an injunction against Ferguson, Holyoak, and Robbins ordering them to treat plaintiffs as FTC Commissioners.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 11, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that because there is no dispute about the facts and the governing law is clear, there is no barrier to proceeding straight to summary judgment.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 23, Defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and supporting memorandum. Defendants argue that the executive power of the president encompasses the authority to remove those who aid the President in carrying out his duties and that therefore the removal of Slaughter and Bedoya was a lawful exercise of presidential power.\nUpdate 3: On May 5, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum of law in further support of their motion for expedited summary judgment and in opposition to the Defendants\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgment.\nUpdate 4: On May 12, Defendants filed a reply in support of their cross-motion for summary judgment, alleging that the restrictions on the removal of FTC Commissioners are unconstitutional and that the Plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief sought.\nUpdate 5: On July 17, Judge Alikhan granted a summary judgment and permanent injunction, ordering the administration to reinstate former FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter to her previous role. Citing Supreme Court precedent, the court found the administration\u2019s termination of Ms. Slaughter violated the FTC Act\u2019s removal protections. However, the court dismissed a parallel claim by former Commissioner Alvaro Bedoya as moot, noting he had voluntarily resigned. The administration filed a motion to stay the decision pending appeal.2025-07-17\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Removal of independent agency leadersSamuels v. Trump (D.D.C.) \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01069 Complaint2025-04-09Overview: On Jan. 27, 2025, President Donald Trump removed Plaintiff Jocelyn Samuels from her position as Commissioner of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Samuels brought suit arguing that the EEOC is an independent agency, and President Trump does not have authority to remove her prior to the end of her term in 2026. Samuels asked the court to declare her removal unlawful and for injunctive relief to allow her to perform her duties as Commissioner. \nCase Summary. On Jan. 27, 2025, President Donald Trump removed Plaintiff Jocelyn Samuels from her position as Commissioner at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).  Samuels alleges that the EEOC is an independent agency, and because of this, President Trump\u2019s action was ultra vires in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, because he does not have the authority to remove her as Commissioner before the end of her term in 2026.\nSamuels asked the court to declare her termination unlawful and that she remains a Commissioner of the EEOC. She further requested that the court enjoin Defendants from blocking her access to office or preventing her from performing her role as Commissioner.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 24, Choices Pregnancy Centers of Greater Phoenix, Inc. and Christian Employers Alliance filed a Motion to Intervene as Intervenor-Defendants. The Parties oppose certain mandates advanced by the Plaintiff during her tenure at EEOC and move to intervene on the basis of their strong interest in keeping the Plaintiff out of office.2025-04-24\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Removal of independent agency leadersBoyle v.

The plaintiffs, all confirmed by the Senate for staggered terms under President Biden, allege they were dismissed in violation of a statute that permits removal of CPSC commissioners only for \u201cneglect of duty or malfeasance in office.\u201d They seek declaratory and injunctive relief to block enforcement of their terminations and to be restored to their positions. On June 13, the district court ruled for the Plaintiffs. The Trump Administration has since appealed the district court\u2019s ruling. \nCase Summary: Under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2053, the CPSC is an independent regulatory agency with five members. CPSC Commissioners serve staggered seven-year terms and may be removed by the president \u201cfor neglect of duty or malfeasance in office but for no other cause.\u201d The plaintiffs allege that they were informed of their removal by White House personnel without being given any justification. They argue that this action violates statutory limits on the president\u2019s removal authority and exceeds the president\u2019s powers under the governing statute. The lawsuit names President Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, OMB Director Russell Vought, and Acting CPSC Chairman Peter Feldman as defendants.\nUpdate 1: On June 13, Judge issued a summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs.\nUpdate 2: On June 16, Defendants appealed Judge Maddox\u2019s summary judgment order to the Fourth Circuit.\nUpdate 3: On July 1, an appeals court declined to stay the lower court\u2019s injunction preventing the administration from removing Consumer Project Safety Commissioners. The court noted that the administration\u2019s termination is \u201cplainly in conflict with the textual language of the statutory removal protections, render[ing] the terminations legally ineffective.\u201d The court also ruled that stopping the injunction would harm the plaintiffs and the public, and keeping the plaintiffs\u2019 position \u201cpreserves, rather than disrupts, agency operations.\u201d2025-07-01\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Removal of independent agency leadersPerlmutter v. Blanche (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01659Complaint2025-05-22Overview: Overview: Shira Perlmutter is challenging her removal by the Trump administration as Register and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office. The complaint alleges that only the Librarian of Congress has statutory authority to appoint or remove the Register, and that President Trump\u2019s attempt to replace her\u2014and appoint an acting Librarian\u2014is unlawful. \nCase Summary: On May 8, 2025 President Trump fired Dr.Carla D. Hayden, the Librarian of Congress. On May 10, Plaintiff Shira Perlmutter was informed by an email from an assistant to President Trump that on behalf of the President, her position as the Register of Copyrights and Director at the U.S. Copyright office had been terminated, effective immediately. On May 12, President Trump appointed the Deputy Attorney General at the U.S. Department of Justice, Todd Blanche, as acting Librarian of Congress. Mr. Blanche subsequently sent two Justice Department officials to the Library of Congress to attempt to access the U.S. Copyright Office and assume the positions of acting Deputy Librarian of Congress and Register of Copyrights. \nThe Plaintiff claims that her removal as Register of Copyrights violates the Separation of Powers and Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, as pursuant to the Appointments Clause, only the head of a Department can appoint inferior officers such as the Register of Copyrights. Ms. Perlmutter contends that the appointment of Defendant Blanche as acting Librarian of Congress is ultra vires because it is not authorized by the Constitution or any statutory provision and was done without the advice and consent of the Senate, and further that this appointment could not be authorized under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act as the Library of Congress is not an \u201cExecutive agency\u201d within the meaning of this act. She argues that therefore her removal from her position by President Trump, Mr. Blanche or any other Defendant is unlawful as no Defendant is lawfully the Librarian of Congress. \nPlaintiff requests that the Court declare that she remains the Register of Copyrights and Director of the U.S. Copyright Office, that Mr. Blanche has not been lawfully appointed as the acting Librarian of Congress, and that the Federal Vacancies Reform Act does not authorize the appointment of a temporary acting Librarian of Congress, She also asks for a  preliminary and permanent injunction ordering that she may not be removed from her office absent a decision by a lawfully appointed Librarian of Congress, that Mr. Blanche may not exercise the powers of acting Librarian of Congress, and that Defendants may not appoint any other individual in that role.2025-05-22\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Removal of independent agency leadersBrown v.

He alleges that his removal was unlawful because it was not due to inefficiency, neglect of his duties, or malfeasance in office. \nCase Summary: On May 5, 2025, Plaintiff Alvin Brown was removed from his position as a Board member of the National Transportation Safety Board by the Trump administration. Plaintiff alleges that he was not removed for inefficiency, neglect of his duties, or malfeasance in office, so his removal was an ultra vires action that violated the Independent Safety Board Act of 1974. Plaintiff requests that the court declare that his removal was unlawful and to enjoin Defendants from blocking Plaintiff from access to his office or otherwise impeding on his ability to fulfill his job duties. 2025-06-04\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling of USAID (Executive Order 14169) (State Dept stop-work order)American Foreign Service Association v. Trump (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00352Complaint 2025-02-06Overview: Two unions sued the Trump administration, challenging its efforts to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development (\u201cUSAID\u201d). The unions argue that the efforts are unconstitutional, violate federal law, and exceed the scope of agency authority. The unions have asked the court to declare the administration\u2019s actions unlawful and unconstitutional, and immediately stop the administration\u2019s efforts by appointing an independent administrator, restoring funding, and voiding the suspension of employees. The court initially stopped the administration from suspending employees but did not restore funding; however, on February 21, 2025, the court reversed its earlier temporary restrictions on the administration, on the basis that the dispute could be resolved outside of the court. On March 10, 2025, the unions filed a new motion arguing that the court should have jurisdiction to decide this dispute. \nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order including a 90-day pause in \u201cforeign development assistance,\u201d and the Secretary of State then issued stop-work orders for United States Agency for International Development (USAID) foreign assistance grants. Later, Secretary of State Rubio was named as acting USAID Administrator and USAID contractors were laid off or furloughed. On Feb. 3, Elon Musk posted that he had spent the previous weekend \u201cfeeding USAID to the woodchipper,\u201d and USAID headquarters in Washington, D.C. was closed. On Feb. 4, a message was posted on the USAID website that all directly-hired USAID staff would be placed on administrative leave as of 11:59pm EST on Friday, Feb. 7, 2025. Plaintiffs sued, arguing executive actions either to dissolve USAID or merge it with the State Department are unconstitutional violations of the separation of powers and the Take Care Clause; and unlawful under of the Administrative Procedure Act by exceeding statutory authority, violating the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, and involving arbitrary and capricious abuses of discretion. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the administration\u2019s actions are unlawful and unconstitutional; a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction directing the administration to halt efforts to shut down the agency, including by appointing an independent administrator, restoring grant funding, recalling furloughs, and halting efforts to place more employees on administrative leave, among other actions. Plaintiffs also seek court supervision, and a permanent injunction barring the administration from taking action to dissolve USAID absent congressional authorization. \nUpdate 1: On Feb. 7, Judge Carl J. Nichols issued a temporary restraining order preventing USAID from placing employees on administrative leave or evacuating them. He rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 request for a restraining order on the funding freeze on the ground that the plaintiffs (USAID employees) could not show sufficient harm to themselves. \nUpdate 2: On Feb. 13, the court extended the TRO until Friday, Feb. 21, at 11:59 PM. Judge Nichols also amended the TRO\u2019s statement to clarify that no USAID employees can be involuntarily evacuated from their host countries while the TRO remains in place.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 14, the Government submitted a declaration by Pete Marocco, who performs the duties and functions of both Deputy Administrators of USAID; the declaration responds to the court\u2019s questions about government actions to protect USAID employees abroad subject to administrative leave or in the event of employees staying voluntarily beyond the time of an evacuation.\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 21, Judge Nichols issued an Order and Memorandum Opinion rejecting the preliminary injunction and dissolving the TRO. His reasoning included that plaintiffs do not face irreparable harm after a series of concessions from Deputy Administrator Marocco, and that they could pursue remedies with administrative bodies governing disputes between the federal government and civil servants. \nUpdate 5: On Mar. 10, Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment, arguing that the court (not administrative bodies) has jurisdiction over the claim, and that Defendants\u2019 actions violate both the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. \nUpdate 6: On Mar. 11, Plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order alleging potential destruction of documents, including a copy of an internal email from Acting Executive Secretary of USAID Erica Carr to staff.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 12, the Defendants responded to the Mar. 11 motion for a temporary restraining order and included an affidavit by Carr. The defendants stated that the instruction to destroy documents \u201chad nothing to do with this litigation,\u201d was done to clear space formerly occupied by USAID, and were copies \u201cwhere the originally classified document is retained by another government agency and for which there is no need for USAID to retain a copy.\u201d\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 14, the Plaintiffs dropped their Mar. 11 motion on destruction of documents based on the Defendants\u2019 assurances.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 7, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. Defendants also filed a memorandum supporting their motion and opposing Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Defendants argued that Plaintiffs failed to challenge any discrete agency action as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. They also argued that Plaintiffs\u2019 request to overturn Defendants\u2019 policy actions would effectively place USAID in receivership overseen by the Court, which they argue is not the role of the judiciary.\nUpdate 10: On Apr. 21, the Plaintiffs filed a combined reply in support of their motion for summary judgment and in opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment. The Plaintiffs claim that there is no jurisdictional barrier to relief, the case is not moot, the Plaintiffs have asserted Article III injuries, and the Defendants\u2019 closure of USAID is unconstitutional.2025-04-21\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling of USAID (Executive Order 14169) (State Dept stop-work order)AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. United States Department of State  (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00400Complaint2025-02-10Overview: Two nonprofit organizations sued the Trump administration over the suspension of United States Agency for International Development (\u201cUSAID\u201d) funding. The organizations argue that the suspensions have harmed their work and employees, exceed the President\u2019s scope of authority, and violate the Constitution. The organizations have asked the court to declare the suspension unlawful, immediately reinstate funding, and stop enforcement of the suspension. The court stopped the enforcement of a blanket suspension of funding but did not stop the underlying Executive Order (EO 14169) which affects employment and contracts. The organizations subsequently argued that the administration failed to comply with the order, to which the court ordered enforcement on the administration but did not expressly acknowledge any noncompliance. The Trump administration appealed this case up to the US Supreme Court. On March 5, 2025, the Supreme Court decided that the administration must continue to pay already appropriated foreign assistance funds. On March 10, the District Court ordered the government to pay nearly $2 billion in foreign assistance for work performed before Feb. 13, but it did not reject the State Department\u2019s review and termination of thousands of foreign aid contracts for work after that date. On April 1, the Trump administration appealed the District Court\u2019s Mar. 10 decision to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit). \nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order including a 90-day pause in \u201cforeign development assistance,\u201d and the Secretary of State then issued stop-work orders for United States Agency for International Development (USAID) foreign assistance grants.\nPlaintiffs, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC) and Journalism Development Network (JDN), sued for declaratory and injunctive relief to stop the implementation of the Executive Order and the stop-work order.  Plaintiffs are two nonprofit organizations that receive federal grants from USAID to support their work. Both AVAC\u2019s and JDN\u2019s  funding was appropriated by Congress through the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act. Plaintiffs allege the Executive Order and stop-work order have been detrimental to their work, forcing them to lay off staff, slashing their budgets, and impacting their ability to carry out their missions. They allege the President acted ultra vires and usurped legislative authority. They also allege the President has violated the Take Care Clause. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the State Department, USAID, Secretary of State Marc Rubio, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and OMB Director Vought are that the stop-work orders are arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Anti-Deficiency Act (as an \u201cunlawful reserve\u201d), and the Impoundment Control Act. Plaintiffs seek a declaration from the court that the suspension of foreign aid is unlawful, an injunction stopping defendants from enforcing the Executive Order, and an order to immediately reinstate foreign assistance funding.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 12, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO enjoining Defendants from enforcing the Executive Order and State Department policy, enjoining stop-work orders, and reinstating foreign assistance funding and administration.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 13, the court granted a TRO in this case and Global Health Council v. Trump on narrower terms than originally requested. The order enjoins implementation on the blanket suspension of foreign aid funding, but does not enjoin enforcement or implementation of Executive Order 14169, individual personnel decisions, or termination of individual contracts.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 19, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for contempt seeking to enforce the Feb. 13 TRO against Defendants and hold them in civil contempt. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants\u2019 purported compliance with the TRO \u201cstrains credulity\u201d and that Defendants have continued to suspend funding and enforce stop-work orders in violation of the court\u2019s orders.  \nUpdate 4: On Feb. 20, the court granted in part plaintiffs\u2019 motion for enforcement of the court\u2019s TRO \u201cto the extent Defendants have not complied with the terms of the TRO,\u201d but did not make a finding of contempt, citing \u201cDefendants\u2019 explicit recognition that \u2018prompt compliance with the order\u2019 is required.\u201d The granted motion applies to this case and Global Health Council v. Trump.\nUpdate 5: On Feb. 24, plaintiffs in Global Health Council v. Trump filed an emergency renewed motion to enforce the TRO. The court held a hearing the following day and, on Feb. 25, granted the motion for a proposed order requiring the Administration pay all invoices and letter of credit drawdown requests for work completed prior to the TRO, as well as reimbursements on grants and assistance agreements by 11:59 pm on Wednesday, Feb. 26. The court further mandated that the Administration take no actions to impede and must ensure the prompt payment of appropriated foreign assistance funds going forward. The court also reportedly ordered the government to provide the court, by Feb. 26 at noon, with all internal directives to agency employees concerning compliance with the TRO. \nUpdate 6: On Feb. 25, the Government submitted a notice of its decision to appeal the court\u2019s decision to the DC Circuit, and a motion to stay the court\u2019s order pending appeal.\nUpdate 7: On Feb. 26, the district court rejected and the D.C. Circuit dismissed the Government\u2019s motion for a stay.\nUpdate 8: On Feb. 26, the Government filed an application with the U.S. Supreme Court (while the decision before the D.C. Circuit was still pending) to vacate the district court\u2019s TRO and grant an immediate administrative stay. That evening, Chief Justice Roberts granted an administrative stay and ordered a response by the plaintiffs by Feb. 28 at 12:p.m. EST.\nUpdate 9: On Feb. 28, the Plaintiffs filed its opposition to the application.\nUpdate 10: On Mar. 5, the Supreme Court rejected the Defendants\u2019 petition in a 5-4 decision.\nUpdate 11: On Mar. 6, Judge Amir H. Ali ruled from the bench that the government must make outstanding balances to the Plaintiffs by Mar. 10; but did not resolve the payments for foreign aid recipients other than the Plaintiffs, which total near $2 billion.\nUpdate 12: On Mar. 10, Judge Ali granted in part and denied in part the motion for a preliminary injunction. The judge ordered the government to pay nearly $2 billion in foreign assistance for work performed before Feb. 13, but he did not reject the State Department\u2019s review and termination of thousands of foreign aid contracts for work after that date. He ruled that the plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on the claim that the latter actions flowed from the original government directives in violation of the law. \nUpdate 13: On Apr. 1, Defendants appealed Judge Ali\u2019s Mar. 10 order granting in part and denying in part the motion for a preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit.\nUpdate 14: On May 2, Plaintiffs amended their complaint. This updated complaint added the Center for Victims of Torture (CVT) as a plaintiff, provided more detailed accounts of the harms suffered by each plaintiff, refined and expanded the legal arguments, and also clarified the forms of relief sought.\nUpdate 15: On May 13, the Court denied the Defendants\u2019 motion for an indicative ruling and vacated the administrative stay. \nUpdate 16: On June 5, the Court struck the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to comply with Local Civil Rule 7(e). 2025-06-05\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling of USAID (Executive Order 14169) (State Dept stop-work order)Global Health Council v. Trump (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. \u200b\u200b1:25-cv-00402Complaint2025-02-11Overview: A group of organizations sued the Trump administration for defunding the United States Agency for International Development (\u201cUSAID\u201d), laying off employees, and attempting to dismantle the agency. The group argues that these actions violated the Constitution and federal laws, and exceeded the authority of the agencies and the President. The group has asked the court to void all actions taken by the administration, and stop the administration from implementing the underlying Executive Order (EO 14169). The Trump administration appealed this case up to the US Supreme Court. On March 5, 2025, the Supreme Court decided that the administration must continue to pay already appropriated foreign assistance funds. On March 10, the District Court ordered the government to pay nearly $2 billion in foreign assistance for work performed before Feb. 13, but it did not reject the State Department\u2019s review and termination of thousands of foreign aid contracts for work after that date. On April 1, the Trump administration appealed the District Court\u2019s Mar. 10 decision to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C, Circuit). \nCase Summary: A group of for-profit and nonprofit organizations that contract with USAID sued the Trump administration over its recent actions to defund USAID, lay off or furlough employees, and transfer the Agency to be under the State Department. Plaintiffs provide a detailed chronology of the actions, memoranda, and statements that the Administration has issued. In addition to imperiling future projects by freezing future funds, plaintiffs also allege that there is money unpaid for services already performed. ($3,376,832 for Democracy International, approximately $120 million for DAI, $103.6 million for Chemonics, and tens of millions for SBAIC\u2019s members.) Plaintiffs allege that neither the President, nor the Secretary of State, nor the USAID Administrator have the authority to unilaterally withhold already-appropriated funds, citing the Constitution and statutory law prohibiting the unilateral withholding: the Impoundment Control Act and the Anti-Deficiency Act. Plaintiffs also claim violations of the Administrative Procedure Act; that the Executive\u2019s actions were arbitrary and capricious, and contrary to statutory and constitutional law. Plaintiffs ask the court to vacate and set aside all of the defendants\u2019 actions to implement Executive Order 14169 and seek injunctions to prevent defendants from continuing to implement EO 14169 and from \u201cdismantling USAID.\u201d\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 11, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO enjoining implementation of the Executive Order and State Department Memorandum.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 13, the court granted a TRO in this case and AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v. United States Department of State on narrower terms than originally requested. The order enjoins implementation on the blanket suspension of foreign aid funding, but does not enjoin enforcement or implementation of Executive Order 14169, individual personnel decisions, or termination of individual contracts.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 20, the court granted in part plaintiffs\u2019 motion for enforcement of the court\u2019s TRO \u201cto the extent Defendants have not complied with the terms of the TRO,\u201d but did not make a finding of contempt, citing \u201cDefendants\u2019 explicit recognition that \u2018prompt compliance with the order\u2019 is required.\u201d The granted motion applies to this case and AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition v.

Circuit.\nUpdate 13: On Apr. 11, Defendants filed a motion for an indicative ruling and an unopposed motion to stay the Mar. 10 order pending the resolution of the motion for an indicative ruling. Defendants seek the indicative ruling in light of the Supreme Court granting the Government\u2019s request for a stay in Department of Education v. California.\nOn that same day, Defendants\u2019 unopposed motion for a partial administrative stay of the Mar. 10 preliminary injunction was granted by Judge Ali.\nUpdate 14: On Apr. 22, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint against all Defendants.

Trump et al (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00469Complaint2025-02-18Overview: The Personal Services Contractor Association, representing contractors from the US Agency for International Development (\u201cUSAID\u201d), challenged President Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Order that suspended U.S. foreign aid and began dismantling USAID. They seek both an immediate temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction to prevent USAID's dismantling and the freezing of congressionally appropriated foreign assistance funds.On Mar. 6, a federal judge denied the contractors\u2019 request for the temporary restraining order.  \nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order including a 90-day pause in \u201cforeign development assistance,\u201d and the Secretary of State then issued stop-work orders for United States Agency for International Development (USAID) foreign assistance grants. \nThe Personal Services Contractor Association filed suit on Feb. 18, 2025, challenging Executive Order 14169 and subsequent actions that effectively suspended U.S. foreign aid and began dismantling USAID. The plaintiffs, representing USAID contractors, allege these actions have caused severe disruption, including contractors being locked out of facilities and email, facing eviction overseas, losing access to healthcare, and being unable to carry out humanitarian aid work. The plaintiffs bring four causes of action: (1) violation of separation of powers against Trump, (2) violation of the Take Care Clause against Trump, (3) violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for arbitrary and capricious actions against all defendants except Trump, and (4) violation of the APA for actions not in accordance with law (including under the Impoundment Act and Anti-Deficiency Act) against all defendants except Trump. The plaintiffs seek both immediate temporary relief (to restore USAID contractors to their pre-January 20 employment status and work conditions) and permanent injunctive relief to prevent USAID's dismantling, its absorption into the State Department, and the freezing of congressionally-appropriated foreign assistance funds without congressional approval. They also request ongoing compliance monitoring through regular status reports.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 19, Plaintiff submitted a motion for a temporary restraining order, including 13 Declarations as Exhibits. \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 6, Judge Carl Nichols ruled from the bench denying the contractors' request for the temporary restraining order. Judge Nichols said the complaints should be adjudicated by the board of contract appeals or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The judge also said the plaintiffs had not established that they would suffer irreparable harm or that a TRO was in the public interest.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 11, Plaintiff filed an emergency motion for a TRO to preserve evidence after Erica Carr, the executive secretary of USAID, circulated an email instructing the remaining USAID staff members to shred and burn classified and personal documents. Defendants opposed this motion the next day, asserting that USAID was not destroying evidence potentially relevant to this litigation. On Mar. 13, Plaintiff replied in further support of its motion, however Judge Nichols denied its motion on Mar. 14 on the grounds that Plaintiff failed to meet its burden of proof for emergency relief.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 17, Plaintiff amended its complaint, adding an ultra vires allegation against Defendants and requesting that the court issue a preliminary and permanent injunction to order Defendants to apportion congressionally appropriated funds to USAID as well as restore and maintain apportionment data for OMB\u2019s apportioned funds to USAID. Plaintiff also requested that Defendants be blocked from taking steps to suspend, eliminate, consolidate, or downsize USAID without Congressional authorization.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 23, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. In its supporting memorandum, Plaintiff explains court interference via preliminary injunction is necessary because Defendants have terminated the entire USAID global workforce, thereby abolishing USAID.\nUpdate 6: On May 7, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s preliminary injunction motion, asserting that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff\u2019s claims and that the claims are not likely to succeed on their merits.2025-05-07\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Denial of State Department FundsNational Endowment for Democracy v. United States (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00648Complaint2025-03-05Overview: The National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a nonprofit organization focused on protecting democratic institutions, filed a lawsuit alleging that the administration withheld funds given to the NED by Congress. The NED asked the court to temporarily block the Executive Branch from further withholding funds while the case is pending, but this request has been put on hold as of Mar. 11 because the NED is in the process of receiving the federal funds in question. \nCase Summary: The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) filed suit challenging the Executive Branch\u2019s withholding of funds appropriated to the Endowment by Congress. The NED was established by the National Endowment for Democracy Act of 1983. In the Act, Congress specified that the NED would be funded by annual congressional appropriations, which would then be disbursed to the Endowment via grants from the Department of State. The statute also prescribes that the Endowment must withdraw funds from an account held by the Department of Treasury on an as-needed basis. The original complaint alleges that for the past month, \u201cthe Executive Branch has denied the Endowment access to its congressionally appropriated funds\u2014something that has never occurred before in the Endowment\u2019s forty-two-year existence.\u201d In response to the court\u2019s initial injunction, the impounded funds were turned over by the government. However, the complaint as amended on June 30 alleges that the Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) has not apportioned funds Congress designated for NED for the fiscal year 2025. As a result, the Endowment claims it is \u201cexperiencing a devastating cash flow crisis that jeopardizes its ability to fulfill its mission and its very existence, as well as that of its core institutes and grantees.\u201d The complaint alleges that the Executive Branch is obligated by the NED Act to grant the funds appropriated by Congress, and by not doing so, it is acting \u201ccontrary to law and in excess of statutory authority because the statutory scheme creates a mandatory, non-discretionary duty for Defendants to make available, obligate, and disburse the Endowment\u2019s congressionally appropriated funds.\u201d The complaint argues that the administration\u2019s actions constitute an \u201cunlawful impoundment\u201d in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, the All Writs Act, the Presentment Clause, the Appropriations Clause, the Take Care Clause, and the Separation of Powers. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction barring Defendants from impounding the Endowment\u2019s funds.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 6, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 11, parties jointly moved to stay proceedings on the TRO because the NED received part of its obligated funds requested in late Jan. and is in the process of receiving the remaining appropriated funds. The court granted the motion. \nUpdate 3: The Plaintiffs on June 30 amended the complaint to allege that the OMB has not apportioned the funds Congress had already budgeted for fiscal year 2025 for NED.2025-06-30\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling the U.S. African Development Foundation (Executive Order 14217)Brehm v. Marocco (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00660Complaint2025-03-06Overview: Ward Brehm, a U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF) Board member filed a lawsuit against Pete Marocco (recently appointed acting Chair of the USADF Board), DOGE, and President Donald Trump, alleging Trump\u2019s Executive Order eliminating certain government offices, including USADF, was unlawful. Brehm asked the court to temporarily block his own removal and Marocco\u2019s appointment while the case proceeds and/or to block the EO in its entirety. While the federal judge agreed to block Rehm\u2019s removal and Marocco\u2019s appointment on an immediate and short-term basis on March 6, on March 11, that same judge did not agree to further temporarily block the actions while the case proceeds from there. \nCase Summary: On Feb. 19, President Trump issued Executive Order 14217, which directed that \u201cnon-statutory components and functions\u201d of four government entities, including the U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF), \u201cbe eliminated,\u201d among other actions. On Feb. 21, DOGE allegedly demanded access to USADF information systems, and USADF staff informed them of legal requirements that DOGE employees would have to satisfy before access was provided. On Feb. 24, Ward Brehm, a member of the USADF Board, allegedly received notice from the White House Presidential Personnel Office (PPO) that he had been terminated. On Feb. 28, USADF management allegedly received a letter from PPO appointing Pete Marocco as acting Chair of the Board of USADF. On Mar. 3, previously appointed members of the Board allegedly held an emergency meeting and determined that Marocco\u2019s appointment was unlawful. On Mar. 5, Brehm allegedly informed DOGE that Marocco did not hold a position with USADF and instructed USADF staff to deny him access to its offices.\nOn Mar. 6, Brehm in his personal and official capacity, filed suit against Marocco, DOGE, and President Trump, arguing the defendants actions are (1) an ultra vires violation of the African Development Foundation Act as Marocco was neither nominated to the Board nor confirmed by the Senate; (2) an ultra vires violation of the separation of powers; (3) a violation of the APA as not in accordance with the law and in excess of statutory authority. Brehm seeks a declaratory judgment that he is the President of USADF and Marocco\u2019s appointment was unlawful; preliminary and permanent injunctive relief; and, in the alternative, a writ of mandamus prohibiting his removal by any entity other than the Board. \nThe same day, plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 6, Judge Richard J. Leon issued an administrative stay prohibiting Brehm from being removed from office and Marocco from being appointed to the Board.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 11, Judge Leon issued a Memorandum Order denying the TRO request. \u201cThe heart of the problem is that Brehm has not identified any cognizable irreparable harm to himself as opposed to potential harm to the agency and its partners,\u201d Judge Leon wrote (emphasis in original). As an aside, Judge Leon wrote that \u201cBrehm raise[sic] a colorable Appointment Clause claim,\u201d that the Vacancy Act does not permit the appointment of Marocco and \u201c[t]he Court has not found\u2013nor has the Government identified\u2013any other statute that provides President Trump with the authority to appoint Marocco as the Acting Chairman of the Board.\u201d\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 21, the Plaintiff submitted a motion for summary judgment and for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 31, Defendants submitted a cross-motion for summary judgment alongside their opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. Defendants contend that Brehm is not entitled to the requested relief, asserting that the harm he may have experienced is neither irreparable nor warrants extraordinary relief.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 4, Plaintiffs filed a combined reply in support of their motion for summary judgment and preliminary injunction and in response to Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs request that the court enter an order confirming Brehm as the lawful President of USADF and reject Defendants\u2019 efforts to circumvent the role that the Appointments Clause provides Congress in the appointment of federal officers.\nOn that same day, Plaintiffs filed a response to Defendants\u2019 statement of material facts as to which there is no genuine dispute.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 9, Defendants filed a reply in further support of their cross motion for summary judgment, arguing that Brehm cannot succeed on the merits of his case. \nUpdate 7: On Jun. 10, Judge Leon dismissed a lawsuit challenging the administration\u2019s attempt to dismantle the U.S. African Development Foundation (USADF), finding that President Trump was acting within his legal authority when he fired the USADF\u2019s board members in February. 2025-06-10\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling the U.S. African Development Foundation (Executive Order 14217)Rural Development Innovations Limited v.

Russell Vought (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00381\n\nD.C. Circuit Case No. 25-5091Complaint (Feb. 6, 2025)\n\nAmended Complaint (Feb. 13, 2025)\n2025-02-09Overview: National Treasury Employees Union, representing employees across 37 federal agencies and departments including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), challenged the Trump Administration's efforts to shut down the CFPB and requested a temporary restraining order against the CFPB and Acting Director Russell Vought. A federal judge ordered the Administration to stop deleting and removing records, terminating employees without cause, or disbursing funds except for operating expenses, while the case proceeds. The government appealed this order. The Appeals Court overturned the order in part, but required the government to terminate employees only after a particularized assessment that doing so would not interfere with the CFPB\u2019s statutory duties. The district court subsequently blocked a massive reduction in force, and the Court of Appeals went further in supporting the district court\u2019s order and removing one of the obstacles it had imposed on the district court\u2019s original order. \nCase Summary: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was created by Congress in the aftermath of the 2007\u20132008 great recession, to support and protect American consumers in the financial marketplace. On Feb. 7, 2025, Elon Musk posted \u201cCFPB RIP\u201d with a tombstone emoji on his X account. On Feb. 8, Russell Vought, the Acting Director of the CFPB, posted on X that he had notified the Federal Reserve that CFPB would not take \u201cits next draw of unappropriated funding because it is not \u2018reasonably necessary\u2019 to carry out its duties.\u201d In an email to CFPB employees, Vought directed the CFPB workforce to \u201ccease all supervision and examination activity,\u201d \u201ccease all stakeholder engagement,\u201d pause all pending investigations, not issue any public communications, and pause \u201cenforcement actions.\u201d He also notified the CFPB workforce that the Washington headquarters would be closed for the coming week. Plaintiffs allege that preventing CFPB from drawing down more funding and ordering a halt on enforcement activities constitutes an unlawful attempt to thwart Congress\u2019s decision to create CFPB, which would be a violation of the separation of powers. They seek a declaratory judgment that Vought\u2019s directives are unlawful and an injunction that prevents him from further attempts to dismantle CFPB\u2019s supervision and enforcement work.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 13, Plaintiffs moved for an administrative stay and TRO enjoining defendants from taking action to terminate CFPB staff, requiring that cease work directives be lifted, and enjoining further efforts to suspend operations at CFPB.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 14, 2025, the court ordered that the defendants not delete, destroy, remove, or impair records; terminate any employee other than for cause or issue any notice of reduction-in-force to any CFPB employee; or disburse any funds, except to satisfy CFPB\u2019s operating obligations, pending the resolution of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a TRO. The order also reclassified plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a TRO as a motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 24, the government filed a memorandum in opposition to the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 12, both parties filed a joint notice agreeing to extend the contract termination agreement until Mar. 28 or until the court rules on Plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction, whichever comes first. The CFPB agreed to continue to freeze all termination actions regarding contracts during this period.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 28, Judge Amy Berman Jackson granted a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 29, the government appealed Judge Jackson\u2019s preliminary injunction order to the D.C. Circuit.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 11, following oral argument, the D.C. Circuit, in a per curiam opinion, granted the stay in part. The Circuit stayed the preliminary injunction \u201cinsofar as it prohibits defendants from terminating or issuing a notice of reduction in force to employees whom defendants have determined, after a particularized assessment, to be unnecessary to the performance of defendants\u2019 statutory duties.\u201d\nThe Circuit set the next oral argument for May 16, 2025. \nUpdate 8: On Apr. 17, Plaintiffs submitted a motion for an order to show cause why the Defendants have not violated the part of the court\u2019s preliminary injunction upheld by the DC Circuit through a large-scale termination of employees earlier that day. Judge Jackson ordered a hearing for the following morning.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 18, before the hearing Plaintiffs submitted information about the terminations and Defendants submitted, per a court order, documents on the actions taken and stated reasons for them. \nAfter the hearing, Judge Jackson ordered the \u201cthe Reduction in Force announced by Acting Director Vought on or about April 17, 2025 is SUSPENDED and it may NOT be implemented, effectuated, or completed in any way until this Court has ruled on plaintiffs\u2019 motion to enforce the preliminary injunction\u201d (emphasis in original).\nThe same day, the Defendants appealed the court\u2019s order to the DC Circuit.\nUpdate 10: On Apr. 28, the DC Circuit (in a 2-1 decision) rejected the Defendants\u2019 appeal and reinstated an element of the district court\u2019s original preliminary injunction, which the DC Circuit panel had previously stayed in part.\n2025-04-28\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling of Consumer Financial Protection BureauMayor and City Council of Baltimore et al. v. CFPB (D. Md.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00458-ABAComplaint2025-02-12Overview: The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, along with nonprofit Economic Action Maryland Fund, sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) and Acting Director Russell Vought challenging their actions to defund and halt operations at the CFPB. A federal judge ordered the Administration to stop transferring or relinquishing control of reserve funds, returning any reserve funds to the Federal Reserve or the Department of Treasury, or otherwise reducing funds except for operating expenses while the case proceeds. CFPB has moved to dismiss the case. \nCase Summary: On Feb. 7, 2025, President Trump named OMB Director Russell Vought as the Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). On Feb. 8, Vought instructed CFPB employees to stop performing any work tasks and notified the Federal Reserve Board of Governors that he was requesting $0 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. Plaintiffs allege that these and other statements and actions by Vought, President Trump, and Elon Musk indicate that the CFPB will be deprived of operating funds and will be unable to perform its statutorily mandated functions. Plaintiffs allege that the Baltimore City Law Department has an active account with the CFPB and uses the CFPB customer complaint database and attends trainings put on by the CFPB. Plaintiffs also claim injury because their constituents will be deprived of the CFPB\u2019s enforcement actions against predatory business practices. The second plaintiff, Economic Action Maryland Fund, is a direct services nonprofit that operates in Maryland. For part of its work, the organization relies on the CFPB complaint databases and other resources CFPB publishes under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Plaintiffs claim that defendants\u2019 actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (including that Vought\u2019s actions allegedly violate the statutory requirement for the Director to request transfer of an amount \u201creasonably necessary to carry out the authorities of the Bureau under Federal consumer financial law.\u201d Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment saying as much, as well as an injunction that would prevent defendants from defunding CFPB.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 12, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO enjoining defendants from defunding the CFPB, to which the government responded in opposition on Feb. 20.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 25, Judge Matthew J. Maddox issued an order that prevented the defunding of CFPB, and on Feb. 28, the judge issued an order extending the duration of that directive. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 14, Judge Maddox denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 4: On May 15, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.\nUpdate 5: On June 12, Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice as the Defendants have repeatedly represented that there is no mechanism by which the Defendants can transfer money away from, or otherwise relinquish control over the money in, the Bureau fund. On this basis, the Plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed the action but will undertake further actions as appropriate if the Defendants later transfer Bureau funds in contradiction of their representations.2025-06-12\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling/Restructuring of the Department of Education (Executive Order of Mar. 20, 2025)State of New York v. McMahon (D.Mass)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-10601Complaint2025-03-13Overview:Twenty states and the District of Columbia requested the court to halt the announced Department of Education (DOE) and the Trump administration\u2019s planned Reduction in Force (RIF) of half of the remaining employees of the DOE and closure of the DOE. The states based their claims on violations of the constitutional separation of powers and the Executive\u2019s duty of care to execute laws, and as arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act. The district court has stopped the government\u2019s action while the litigation proceeds. \nCase Summary: On March 13, the Attorneys General of twenty states and the District of Columbia sued the DOE and the Trump administration to halt a planned Reduction in Force (RIF), which would reduce DOE\u2019s staff of 4,133 by approximately 1,378. The RIF is itself only an announced \u201cfirst step\u201d in a \u201ctotal shutdown\u201d by Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, the complaint alleges. The suit points to statutory authority that mandates DOE functions under the 1979 Department of Education Organizing Act and other Acts including the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1965) and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (1975), and other education, disability, and civil rights laws. It states the Secretary of DOE is only authorized to reorganize by \u201callocat[ing] or reallocat[ing] functions among the officers of the Department\u201d or modifying \u201corganizational entities within the Department as may be necessary or appropriate,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 3473(a). Under counts alleging constitutional violations, ultra vires (acts outside of statutory authority), and violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, the states move the Court to vacate efforts to \u201cdismantle\u201d the DOE, to declare them illegal, and to enjoin the RIF.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 24, Plaintiffs submitted a motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 24, Plaintiffs submitted a motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 11, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. Defendants argue that the court should deny relief because the programs identified by Plaintiffs are within the discretion of the Secretary of the DOE instead of being statutorily mandated and that Plaintiffs have failed to identify how the reduction in workforce is tied to the DOE\u2019s inability to perform its statutory duties.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 18, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction in which they claim Defendants\u2019 opposition mischaracterized the mass termination of employees as minor changes.\nUpdate 4: On May 22, Judge Myong Joun granted a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 5: On June 4, a federal appeals court denied the administration\u2019s request to overturn a district court order blocking mass layoffs at the Department of Education while litigation proceeds. \nThe court found that the layoffs would cause irreparable harm by undermining the agency\u2019s capacity to perform its legal functions, emphasizing that the stakes were \u201cwhether a nearly half-century-old cabinet department would be permitted to carry out its statutorily assigned functions or prevented from doing so by a mass termination of employees aimed at implementing the effective closure of that department.\u201d \nUpdate 6: The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to grant a stay of a preliminary injunction that had blocked the administration\u2019s plans to dismantle the Department of Education and fire thousands of department employees. The majority did not provide any reasoning. In dissent, Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, warned that the Court\u2019s order enables the executive branch to functionally \u201cabolish\u201d an entire department \u201cby executive fiat.\u201d2025-07-14\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling/Restructuring of the Department of Education (Executive Order of Mar. 20, 2025)Carter v. Department of Education (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00744Complaint2025-03-14Overview: Two parents and the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates have sued the U.S. Department of Education (DOE), Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, and Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor, challenging their alleged reduction of staffing at the Department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights (OCR) and the OCR\u2019s freezing of investigations into complaints alleging race- and sex-based discrimination. Plaintiffs allege that these actions have inhibited OCR\u2019s ability to process and investigate complaints from the public and have requested that the court order the restoration of OCR\u2019s investigations.\nCase Summary: Shortly after President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, the DOE allegedly froze all investigations with OCR, which is responsible for processing and investigating civil rights complaints by the public. On Mar. 6, 2025, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon ended this \u201cpause\u201d on OCR complaint processing, but has since allegedly closed seven of twelve regional OCR offices and laid off many of the employees at the remaining offices. Plaintiffs, two parents and the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, Inc., filed suit, alleging that the Trump administration\u2019s actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (as arbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with congressional statutes including the Impoundment Act), exceed Defendants\u2019 lawful authority, and violate the Equal Protection guarantee under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that Defendants\u2019 actions are unlawful and injunctive relief to restore OCR\u2019s complaint processing capacities.\nUpdate 1: On Apr.10, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which did not include any new allegations or requests for relief but did include additional plaintiffs and facts.\nUpdate 2: On May 2, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and supporting memorandum. Plaintiffs requested that the court order Defendants to restore OCR\u2019s investigation and processing capacity as well as to process complaints from the public promptly and equitably in accordance with OCR\u2019s statutory and regulatory obligations.\nUpdate 3: On May 12, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction motion.2025-05-12\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling/Restructuring of the Department of Education (Executive Order of Mar. 20, 2025)Somerville Public Schools v.

The district court has stopped the government\u2019s action while the litigation proceeds.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 11, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon initiated a reduction in force eliminating the positions of roughly 2,000 employees, or almost half of the Department of Education\u2019s workforce (\u201cMass Termination Order\u201d). On Mar. 20, President Trump issued an Executive Order ordering McMahon to \u201ctake all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education.\u201d\nPlaintiffs, including public school districts that rely on Department of Education funding and unions representing employees in those school districts, sued, alleging that Congress has exclusive authority to create or eliminate government agencies such that the government\u2019s actions violate the Separation of Powers and are Ultra Vires. The Plaintiffs also allege that the government\u2019s actions violate various prohibitions contained in the Administrative Procedure Act (including \u201carbitrary and capricious conduct;\u201d excess of government authority; and action not in accordance with law). Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment that Trump and McMahon\u2019s actions are unlawful and preliminary and permanent injunctions against the reduction in force and further efforts to dismantle the Department of Education.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 1, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion requests that the court block Defendants from proceeding with the plans outlined in the Mar. 11 Mass Termination Order and order Defendants to reinstate the federal employees whose employment was terminated or otherwise eliminated by the Mass Termination Order.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 11, Defendants filed a memorandum opposing Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, asserting that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims lack justiciability and that Defendants\u2019 actions are valid exercises of agency discretion.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 18, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum supporting their motion for a preliminary injunction, reasserting that Defendants\u2019 actions violate the APA and will irreparably harm Plaintiffs.\nUpdate 4: On May 22, Judge Myong Joun granted a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 5: On May 27, Defendants appealed Judge Joun\u2019s preliminary injunction order.\nUpdate 6: On June 4, a federal appeals court denied the administration\u2019s request to overturn a district court order blocking mass layoffs at the Department of Education while litigation proceeds. \nThe court found that the layoffs would cause irreparable harm by undermining the agency\u2019s capacity to perform its legal functions, emphasizing that the stakes were \u201cwhether a nearly half-century-old cabinet department would be permitted to carry out its statutorily assigned functions or prevented from doing so by a mass termination of employees aimed at implementing the effective closure of that department.\u201d\n\n2025-06-04\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling/Restructuring of the Department of Education (Executive Order of Mar. 20, 2025)Morgan v.

Morgan alleges Secretary McMahon\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise contrary to the Higher Education Act.\nCase Summary: Plaintiff Amanda Morgan alleges that on or about February 18, 2025, the Department of Education (DOE) disabled\nborrowers from accessing the recertification forms and application forms for income-driven repayment plans on the studentaid.gov website. Morgan further alleges that on or about February 26, 2025, DOE issued a memorandum to student loan service providers in which DOE instructed the providers to stop accepting and processing all income-driven repayment applications, including the recertification of income for those borrowers who were already on income-driven repayment plans. Morgan alleges that this decision has resulted in her being put on a new repayment plan that more than quadruples her monthly student loan payment.\nMorgan alleges that Secretary McMahon\u2019s decision is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise contrary to the Higher Education Act. Morgan has requested that the court compel Defendants to restore access to income recertification forms and income-based repayment plans, enjoin her removal from her income-based repayment plans, extend relevant deadlines for her to recertify her income, and provide her with answers to questions posed in the complaint.2025-03-19\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling/Restructuring of the Department of Education (Executive Order of Mar. 20, 2025)Association for Education Finance and Policy Inc. v. McMahon (D.D.C.)\n\nCase no. 1:25-cv-00999Complaint2025-04-04Overview:  The Plaintiffs, two organizations focused on education policy research, challenge the Defendants\u2019 dismantling of the Institute of Education Sciences, the research arm of the Department of Education. They argue that the Defendants acted ultra vires and that their actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act given that they are contrary to the law and arbitrary and capricious.\nCase Summary: Since February 2025, the Defendants have allegedly taken steps to dismantle the Institute of Education Sciences (IES), the research arm of the Department of Education. Actions taken include en masse cancellation of contracts for statutorily mandated work, the mass firing of nearly 90% of IES employees, and the mass termination of remote data licenses, which researchers use to access data held by IED. The Plaintiffs are an association of scholars and practitioners working on education policy and a nonprofit research organization focused on higher education research. The Plaintiffs allege they are harmed by the Defendants\u2019 actions because their members have lost contracts and funding; because the termination of data collection and dissemination by IES will impede the Plaintiffs from undertaking research reliant on IES\u2019s data, given that the data is not reproducible by other entities; and because the Plaintiffs and their members are unable to publish already completed research as a result of the firing of the staff that perform disclosure reviews for data used. The Plaintiffs argue that the Defendants\u2019 actions are ultra vires given that IES was created by statute and can only be dismantled by the same. They also argue that the Defendants violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because their actions are contrary to law as they violate the Education Sciences Reform Act, the Higher Education Opportunity Act, the Impoundment Control Act, and the Anti-Deficiency Act. The Plaintiffs also allege that the Defendants acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the APA. The Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief related to restoring the terminated contracts, vacating the mass firings, and vacating the decision to terminate the remote data licenses. They also seek a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction prohibiting Defendants from acting to shut down IES\u2019s operations.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 17, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and a memorandum in support of the motion, asking the Court to restrain and enjoin Defendants from terminating the functions of IES and to issue an order to reinstate active work status to IES employees whose work is necessary to perform IES\u2019s statutory duties.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 30, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On May 6, Plaintiffs replied in further support of their motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 4: On June 3, Judge Trevor McFadden denied the preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 5: On June 18, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.

Department of Education (D. Md.)\n\nCase No 8:25-cv-01230Complaint2025-04-14Overview:  Two education research nonprofits sued to block DOGE\u2019s termination of federal contracts and staff for the Institute of Education Services (IES), a federal agency under the Department of Education responsible for education statistics research. They argue that the contract and staff terminations violate the required administrative procedure for multiple federal statutes and the Appropriations Act, and also violate the separation of powers. The court denied plaintiffs\u2019 request to temporarily block the termination of contracts and staff, while the case is pending. \nCase Summary: Institute of Education Services (IES) is a federal agency under the Department of Education (DOE) responsible for education statistics research. On Feb. 13, 2025, the DOE cancelled all federal contracts for all ten IES Regional Educational Offices and on Mar. 11, 2025, DOGE announced a mass reduction in force (\u201cRIF\u201d) that placed roughly 90 percent of IES\u2019s staff on leave, pending final termination in June. Plaintiffs, two national education research nonprofits, American Educational Research Association (AERA) and Society for Research on Educational Effectiveness (SREE), filed suit on Apr. 14, 2025 contending that the cancellation of contracts and staff layoffs violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the administrative procedures required under the Education Science Reform Act (ESRA) (which created IES), the Appropriations Act, and other related federal statutes, as well as being a violation of ultra vires and separation of powers principles. Plaintiffs are requesting that the court declare that the Feb. 13 termination of contracts and the Mar. 11 staff terminations unlawful, and to order Defendants to: reinstate the cancelled contracts in within 30 days, prevent the destruction of data by contractors, vacate the Mar. 11 staff termination action, and reinstate terminated staff back in their IES roles. \nUpdate 1: On Apr. 29, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction with accompanying memorandum, on the grounds that irreparable harm will be caused by preventing IES from disseminating research and data to its members, and by the data and findings of the research contracts being lost permanently. On May 12, Defendants filed a memorandum opposing Plaintiff\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction and proposed an alternative order on the motion. On May 19, Plaintiffs filed a reply further supporting their motion for a preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 2: On June 12, Judge Stephanie Gallagher denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, on the basis that the request is overbroad given factual discrepancies and that Plaintiffs have not shown they are entitled to extraordinary relief based on the alleged harms. 2025-06-12\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling/Restructuring of the Department of Education (Executive Order of Mar. 20, 2025)Victim Rights Law Center v.

This reduction in force (RIF) eliminated more than half of the Office of Civil Rights\u2019 (OCR\u2019s) previously 550-person staff, and seven of OCR\u2019s twelve regional offices were closed. With only half of its staff, OCR is unable to fulfill its statutory and regulatory mandates and complete investigations of disability discrimination, racial harassment and discrimination, and sexual harassment in public schools. Due to the RIF, OCR has allowed nearly all of its discrimination complaints to stall and abdicated its responsibilities to whole classes of students. Plaintiffs, including a nonprofit organization focused on providing legal aid to victims of sex-based harassment and assault, dating violence, and stalking in school as well as two children who are victims of harassment at school, sued, alleging that the Defendants acted ultra vires and that their actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) given that they are contrary to the law and arbitrary and capricious. Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment that OCR\u2019s RIF is unlawful and preliminary and permanent injunctions against the RIF.\nUpdate 1: On June 18, Judge Myong Joun granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. Judge Joun\u2019s order blocks Defendants from carrying out the RIF as to OCR employees and implementing a RIF as to these employees under a different name. The order also requires Defendants to stay the termination or elimination of these employees and facilitate their return to duty.2025-06-18\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling/Restructuring of the Department of Education (Executive Order of Mar. 20, 2025)National Academy of Education v.

They argue that the Defendants acted ultra vires and that their actions violate the separation of powers doctrine and the Administrative Procedure Act given that they are contrary to the law, in excess of statutory authority, and arbitrary and capricious.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 11, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon initiated a reduction in force eliminating the positions of roughly 2,000 employees, or almost half of the Department of Education\u2019s workforce. This reduction in force (RIF) eliminated the workforces of the Institute of Education Services (IES) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) by approximately 90% and 97%, respectively (leaving IES with about twenty employees and NCES with three). IES and NCES were established to accomplish the Education Science Reform Act\u2019s goal that the Department of Education collect, maintain, analyze, and disseminate high-quality data through its research initiatives. Plaintiffs include the National Academy of Education (NAEd), a nonprofit focused on education policy and practice, and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME), a professional organization involved with educational research. These organizations allege they now face irreparable harm because of their reliance on data from IES\u2019s Centers for their research on pressing educational issues pertaining to educational inequality in access to resources, opportunities, support, and outcomes. Plaintiffs also allege Defendants\u2019 actions are ultra vires and in violation of separation of powers doctrine and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) for exceeding statutory authority, being arbitrary and capricious, and not in accordance with law. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants\u2019 unlawful restriction of IES\u2019s and its Centers\u2019 data and against Defendants\u2019 imminent and ongoing failure to maintain and update IES\u2019s and its Centers\u2019 data as required by Congress.\nUpdate 1: On June 3, Judge Trevor Neil McFadden denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, noting that APA challenges must focus on specific agency actions and seek equally targeted remedies instead of the widespread modification to agency operations which Plaintiffs seek.2025-06-03\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling/Restructuring of the Department of Education (Executive Order of Mar. 20, 2025)State of California v.

The court has provisionally blocked the government's action.\nCase Summary: Maryland, along with 23 other states and the District of Columbia filed a complaint on April 29, 2025 against Americorps over its decision to place the majority of its staff on leave and its plan to terminate many of them, as well as unilaterally cancelling up to $400 million worth of programming involving the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs claim these actions are in violation of the separation of powers principles as well as the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as allegedly \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d conduct, contrary to law and in excess of statutory authority. They claim the changes were not made through the proper rulemaking process and that these actions exceed the constitutional authority of the executive branch and infringe on the powers of Congress in setting up and allotting funding to Americorps. Plaintiffs claim that the improper winddown of Americorps and cancellation of its programming will cause irreparable harm to both the Plaintiffs and the public at large.\nUpdate 1: On May 6, the Plaintiff States filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and supporting memorandum. Plaintiffs request that the court vacate Defendants\u2019 acts and omissions that contributed to the dismantling of AmeriCorps and enjoin Defendants from taking further actions to dismantle AmeriCorps. \nUpdate 2: Defendants responded in opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction motion on May 13.

Plaintiffs are 15 non-profit entities and 3 individuals who brought suit against AmeriCorps, the Interim Agency Head of AmeriCorps, and the DOGE Team Lead for AmeriCorps, alleging that Defendants are unlawfully attempting to dismantle AmeriCorps in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Separation of Powers, and the Appointments Clause. Plaintiffs allege that these cuts will cause irreparable harm to their organizations, significantly reducing or negating their ability to recruit and retain volunteers and to provide services.\nPlaintiffs allege that Defendants\u2019 attempts to dismantle AmeriCorps violate the APA as arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, unreasonably withheld agency action, and failure to observe procedures required by law. Plaintiffs further allege that Defendants\u2019 actions violate the Separation of Powers, and that Defendant Tahmasebi, the Acting Chief Executive Officer of AmeriCorps, is exercising authority in violation of the Appointments Clause.

They allege that the actions violate the Administrative Procedures Act as in excess of statutory authority, arbitrary and capricious, and ultra vires and also challenge the plan to fund the Garden Project as outside of the statutory charge from Congress for grants awarded by the NEH and thus in violation of the APA. Plaintiffs also claim that Doge\u2019s actions are unconstitutional as Congress did not authorize Doge to conduct the business of the NEH.\nThe Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief related to restoring the terminated grants, vacating the mass firings, and enforcing the expenditure of all funds appropriated to the NEH by Congress.\nUpdate 1: On May 14, this case was consolidated with The Authors Guild v.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security \n(D.D.C.) \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01270\nComplaint2025-04-24Overview:  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) abruptly closed three of its oversight offices. As a result of the closures, three organizations who had filed complaints or requests for assistance with the DHS oversight offices prior to their closure must dedicate resources to more labor-intensive methods of seeking information about DHS policies, reporting rights violations, and immigration advocacy. These organizations allege that the closures are ultra vires actions that are in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and request declaratory and injunctive relief to reverse the closures.\nCase Summary: On March 21, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) abruptly closed its Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL), Citizen and Immigration Services Ombudsman Office (CIS Ombudsman Office), and the Office of Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) (collectively, the DHS Oversight Offices). Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations who had filed complaints or requests for assistance with the DHS Oversight Offices prior to their closure. According to Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs and their clients now face hardship because they benefited from the investigations conducted by and the congressionally mandated reports published by the DHS Oversight Offices. These organizations allege that DHS\u2019s actions are ultra vires, in violation of the constitutional separation of powers, as well as arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Plaintiffs request declaratory and injunctive relief to block DHS from taking further steps to hinder the DHS Oversight Offices\u2019 ability to perform their statutorily mandated tasks.\nUpdate 1: On May 8, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting that the court order Defendants not to take any further actions to to dissolve or cease the statutory functions of CRCL, OIDO, or the CIS Ombudsman\u2019s Office; reverse work stoppages that were ordered for the DHS Oversight Offices; and enjoin Defendants from effectuating reduction-in-force scheduled for May 23, 2025.2025-05-08\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling of Head StartWashington State Association of Head Start and Early Childhood Education and Assistance Program v.

Wash.)\n\nCase No. 2:25-cv-00781Complaint2025-04-28Overview:  A coalition of Head Start providers and parent advocacy groups filed suit challenging the Trump administration's dismantling of Head Start programming nationwide. The Plaintiffs allege that the actions taken by the administration are unconstitutional and violate the Administrative Procedure as contrary to the law and arbitrary and capricious.\nCase Summary: Following President Donald Trump\u2019s February 20 Executive Orders banning \u201cdiversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility\u201d (DEIA), the \u201cindoctrination of gender ideology,\u201d and \u201csupporting or providing services, either directly or indirectly, to removable or illegal aliens,\u201d the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has taken steps to close down Head Start programming nationwide, including  threatening funding consequences for agencies that \u201cpromote\u201d or \u201ctake part\u201d in DEI initiatives, requiring federal grant recipients to certify that they do not and will not operate programs that \u201cadvance or promote\u201d DEI, and shuttering half of Head Start locations and laying off staff across the country.  \nPlaintiffs, a coalition of state Head Start Associations from Washington, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania and non-profits Family Forward Oregon and Parent Voices Oakland, contend that the dismantling of Head Start programming has caused, and will cause, massive disruptions to education, disability and other support services, food security, and health and well-being for children nationally, and will likewise force parents and caregivers to miss work, lose jobs and educational opportunities, and endure significant financial hardship and mental stress. Plaintiffs argue that HHS\u2019s actions 1) violate separation of powers principles by contradicting Congress\u2019s authority, 2) violate the Spending Clause and Appropriations Clause, 3) are impermissibly vague under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, 4) violate the First Amendment\u2019s Freedom of Speech by monitoring and chilling speech based on viewpoint, 5) violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by disallowing \u201cinclusion\u201d based on disability, and 6) are ultra vires. Plaintiffs also allege a number of violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, including that HHS\u2019s actions 1) are not in accordance with law (Congressional Appropriations, the Head Start Act, and the Rehabilitation Act), 2) are arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion, 3) fail to observe procedure required by law, 4) and unlawfully withhold and/or unreasonably delay agency action. \nPlaintiffs seek to have the HHS\u2019s actions determined unconstitutional and unlawful, all actions to dismantle Head Start vacated and set aside, and preliminary and permanent injunctions compelling the HHS to refund Head Start and banning the HHS from dismantling Head Start and enforcing or implementing any DEI bans or anti-DEI Executive Orders.  2025-04-28\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)\nNational Nurses United v. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (D.D.C.)\n\nCase no. 1:25-cv-01538Complaint2025-05-14Overview:  As part of an overhaul of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Trump administration has taken measures to shut down the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which has operated as an agency within the HHS for over 50 years. NIOSH oversees a large portfolio of research, medical, and investigatory programs and services that aim to protect the safety and health of workers in high-risk industries. The Plaintiffs, composed of a vast array of workers associations and unions, allege that the shuttering of NIOSH will cause grave and mounting harm to the health and safety of its members, many of whom work in the high-risk industries previously regulated by NIOSH. \n\nCase Summary: The Trump administration began massive staff cuts at the National Institution for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), ending new and ongoing projects and investigations, ceasing long-provided services, and ending the certification process for safety gear. The Plaintiffs represent many different unions and workers associations, which they allege will be negatively impacted by the closing of NIOSH and cessation of its services in worker safety and health research. Plaintiffs allege in their May 14 Complaint that the administration\u2019s actions to shut down NIOSH and its activities are in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act as  ultra vires, contrary to law, procedurally improper, and arbitrary and capricious.

Jackson (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00804Complaint2025-03-18Overview: On Mar. 18, the United States Institute of Peace (\u201cUSIP\u201d), an independent nonprofit corporation, and several of its Board members filed suit against several officials and entities within the federal government. The Plaintiffs argue that President Trump\u2019s removal of the Board members without following the process mandated by the congressional statute that created and governs USIP is unlawful. They also challenge as unlawful the decision by ex officio Board members Marco Rubio, Pete Hegseth, and Vice Admiral Peter A. Garvin to fire USIP\u2019s President and appoint a new President. Finally they challenge the forcible takeover of USIP\u2019s headquarters by members of the Department of Government Efficiency. On Mar. 19, the Court denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, but has now entered a judgement on the merits for the plaintiffs.  The court of appeals has overturned the district court order and allowed the administration\u2019s action to continue as the litigation proceeds.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 19, President Trump issued an Executive Order (\u201cEO\u201d) mandating the reduction of the size of the federal government. The EO named the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), an independent nonprofit corporation created by Congress, as one of the entities covered by the EO. Since the EO was issued, all of USIP\u2019s Board members were fired by President Trump. Several members of Trump\u2019s cabinet who served as ex officio Board members fired USIP\u2019s President and appointed a new President. Members of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with the help of law enforcement, physically trespassed onto USIP\u2019s headquarters and forcibly took over the building. USIP, along with several Board members, filed suit against numerous Defendants, including President Trump, DOGE, and the ex officio Board members. The Plaintiffs argue that since Congress created USIP as an independent non-profit corporation outside of the Executive Branch, the President has no authority to take action towards USIP not permitted by the statute. They also argue that since the statute outlines the process through which Board members and the President may be removed and because that process was not followed, the removals are unlawful and without legal effect. The Plaintiffs seek preliminary and permanent injunctions ordering that the Board members and President cannot be removed or be treated as having been removed unless the Defendants follow the statutorily required procedure. They also seek injunctions prohibiting trespass against USIP\u2019s real and personal property and prohibiting Defendants from exercising any access or control over USIP\u2019s offices, computer systems, or records. Finally, the Plaintiffs request that the Court declare that the Board Member Plaintiffs remain members of the Board, the President remains in his position, and the President appointed by the ex officio Board members has not been lawfully appointed to any position in USIP. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 19, Defendants filed a motion opposing Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d), asserting that the president\u2019s authority in the firings is unrestricted and non-justiciable, and that Plaintiffs lack standing and have not suffered irreparable harm.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 19, the Court denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a TRO. The Court said the Plaintiffs did not make a sufficient showing of a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 24, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint reflecting additional plaintiffs and details regarding the administration\u2019s ongoing efforts to dismantle the USIP. The amended complaint additionally alleges that Defendants\u2019 actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act and seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction to rescind terminations of USIP leadership taken since initiation of the lawsuit.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 31, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion under the All Writs Act for a status conference on the case and requesting that the court suspend efforts taken by Defendants to transfer USIP property to the General Services Administration until the court can resolve the issue.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 31, Defendants filed a memorandum opposing Plaintiffs\u2019 motion under the All Writs Act, asserting that Plaintiffs have no legal authority to sue and have not shown the requisite likelihood of irreparable harm and that Defendants\u2019 actions were lawful.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 1, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum supporting their motion under the All Writs Act, reasserting that the president does not have at-will removal authority over the USIP\u2019s board of directors.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 1, Judge Beryl Howell issued a minute order denying the All Writs Act motion in part as moot and in part on the merits.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 4, Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and an accompanying statement of material facts, asserting that the facts of the case as stipulated by both parties establish that the president does not have authority to fire members of the USIP\u2019s board at will. \nUpdate 9: On Apr. 5, Plaintiffs filed an amended motion for summary judgement.\nUpdate 10: On Apr. 11, Defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgement and to oppose the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgement. Defendants argue that because USIP does not exercise legislative or judicial functions, it necessarily must be considered to exercise executive functions, thereby making it part of the Executive Branch and making its officers removable by the President. Defendants also argue that, in any case, the Plaintiffs requested relief, reinstatement, is improper and beyond the equitable authority of the courts as it would put the Judicial Branch directly at odds with the President in his exercise of his duties. \nUpdate 11: On Apr. 18, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for summary judgment and in opposition to the Defendants\u2019 cross-motion for summary judgement. Plaintiffs put forth several arguments reiterating their claim that USIP is an independent corporate entity and does not sit within any of the three branches of government. Even if USIP is an executive agency, Plaintiffs argue, the composition of its board allows for placing limitations on the President\u2019s removal of its officers. \nUpdate 12: On Apr. 26, Defendants filed a reply in further support of their cross-motion for summary judgment, asserting the President has the authority to remove USIP\u2019s board in his discretion and that Trump appropriately exercised this discretion through his EO.\nUpdate 13: On May 19, Judge Howell granted a summary judgment for the Plaintiffs.\nUpdate 14: On May 21, Defendants appealed Judge Howell\u2019s summary judgment order.\nUpdate 15: An appeals court issued an unanimous order on June 27 granting the government\u2019s request for an administrative stay. The decision allows the administration to continue enforcing Executive Order 14217 which terminates the \u201cnon-statutory components and functions\u201d of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) and its appointed board members.\nUpdate 16: On June 30, The Plaintiffs petitioned for an emergency rehearing en banc and an emergency administrative stay while the appeals court considers the en banc petition, citing the drastic changes made by DOGE and President Trump.  Plaintiffs argue that similar government action without a stay could endanger its continued operational existence before. 2025-06-30\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Actions Toward US Institute of PeacePippenger v.

Plaintiffs have asked the court to temporarily block defendants from further terminations and to require them to restore already terminated employees to paid leave status so that they can receive certain benefits while this case proceeds. On Apr. 17, 2025, a federal judge denied this request.\nCase Summary: The United States Institute of Peace (USIP) is a non-profit that was created by Congress in 1984 to promote peaceful conflict resolution worldwide. On Mar. 14, 2025, members of the USIP Board of Directors were fired at the direction of President Donald Trump, which was followed by additional employee terminations and other actions by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to terminate USIP programs and contracts. Plaintiffs are former USIP employees, board members, and other affiliates who are suing Trump, DOGE, USIP and others. Plaintiffs allege that (1) the removal of USIP board members and termination of USIP employees were Ultra Vires actions in violation of the USIP Act and the Constitution and arbitrary and capricious actions in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and (2) the dismantling of USIP and its programs was an arbitrary and capricious action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and a violation of the separation of powers / Ultra Vires. Plaintiffs ask the court to enjoin Defendants from transferring assets outside of USIP or further terminating USIP employees, restore certain benefits to those who have already been terminated, and enjoin Defendants from disclosing information about former employees and other USIP affiliates. Plaintiffs also ask the court to declare Defendants\u2019 actions unlawful and ultra vires and restore USIP\u2019s Board.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 14, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a TRO arguing, among other things, that they are suffering irreparable harm as a result of the terminations.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 15, 2025, Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a TRO arguing the terminations were lawful.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 17, 2025, Judge Howell denied Plaintiffs\u2019 TRO for failure to articulate particularized harm and likelihood of success on the merits.2025-04-17\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling Job CorpsNational Job Corps Association v.

Plaintiffs allege that the DOL\u2019s actions have exceeded its authority and were unlawful. Plaintiffs have asked the Court to temporarily prevent Defendants from taking additional steps to eliminate Job Corps, and on June 4, 2025, a federal judge granted this request.\nCase Summary: Starting in March 2025, the US Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d) has taken steps to eliminate Job Corps, a federal residential career training program. These steps included halting applicant background checks, cancelling pending or outstanding Job Corps procurements, and ceasing operations at all contractor-based Job Corps centers. Plaintiffs are DOL contractors that provide Job Corps-related services and a current Job Corps student. Plaintiffs allege that DOL\u2019s actions 1) supersede its statutory authority and are contrary to law, 2) violate the Administrative Procedure Act through arbitrary and capricious action, 3) were ultra vires, and 4) violate the separation of powers. Plaintiffs seek a declaration that Defendants\u2019 actions were unlawful and to enjoin Defendants from taking further steps to eliminate the Job Corps program.\nUpdate 1: On June 4, Judge Andrew Carter granted a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 2: On June 17, Judge Carter extended the temporary restraining order through June 25, 2025.\nUpdate 3: On June 25, Judge Carter issued a nationwide injunction blocking the administration\u2019s planned shutdown of the Department of Labor\u2019s private Job Corps centers. The court found that the closures, which were set to begin within days, likely violate the Administrative Procedure Act and risk unlawfully evicting thousands of at-risk young people.\nUpdate 4: On June 27, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Trump v. Casa, Judge Carter ordered the parties to explain how, if at all, the ruling impacts this proceeding. In response, on June 30, Defendants requested an extension of time to confer with the Department of Justice and DOL, while Plaintiffs asserted that the Casa ruling did not impact the injunction issued on June 25 or the proceedings generally.2025-06-30\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Dismantling Job CorpsCabrera v.

A federal judge reportedly told the Inspectors General to withdraw their request to continue in their roles while the case proceeds. \nCase Summary: On Jan. 24, 2025, the White House sent two-sentence emails to several Inspectors General (IGs) of federal departments and agencies informing them that they had been terminated from their positions. Plaintiffs, eight IGs, subsequently lost access to their government email accounts and computer systems, and were barred from entering their offices, among other actions. They filed suit, arguing their removal violates the Inspector General Act, which requires Congressional notification 30 days before an IG is removed and substantive, case-specific rationale for removal. The suit also argues defendants\u2019 actions are ultra vires; and that plaintiffs are entitled to a writ of mandamus compelling defendants not to obstruct them in the exercise of their duties. They seek a declaratory judgment that the termination emails are legally ineffective and that plaintiffs remain lawful IGs in their agencies; and an injunction to prevent defendants from taking action to prevent plaintiffs from carrying out their duties as IGs.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 14, the judge reportedly told lawyers representing the fired inspectors general to withdraw their motion for a temporary restraining order.2025-02-14\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Large-scale reductions in force / Termination of probationary employees (Executive Order 14210)National Treasury Employees Union v.

The unions argue that mass firings, the \u201cdeferred resignation\u201d program, and preparations for large-scale reductions in force (\u201cRIFs\u201d) violate the Constitution and federal law. The unions have asked the court to declare these actions unlawful and stop agencies from implementing the RIFs and deferred resignation program. \nCase Summary: On Feb. 11, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order instructing agency heads to \u201cundertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs).\u201d Plaintiffs allege that the executive order, along with the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s \u201cdeferred resignation program,\u201d violates separation of powers principles by undermining Congress\u2019s authority, and the Administrative Procedure Act by imposing RIFs contrary to regulations. They seek a declaration that mass firings and the deferred resignation program are unlawful, along with injunctions to prevent agency heads from implementing RIFs and OPM from extending, expanding, or replicating its deferred resignation program.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 14, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 17, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 20, Judge Christopher R.

Md.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00748-ABA\n\nFourth Circuit Case No. 25-1248\nComplaint2025-03-06Overview: Plaintiff states have challenged President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order (\u201cEO\u201d) instructing federal government agency heads to prepare to initiate large-scale reductions in their workforces (RIF). The Plaintiffs claim that the EO violates the Administrative Procedure Act and the regulatory requirements for initiating that type of workforce reduction. They seek the Defendant federal agencies to stop firing probationary employees, reinstate any employees who were fired as part of the mass terminations after President Trump\u2019s second inauguration, not fire any employees pursuant to a RIF before reinstating the allegedly unlawfully terminated employees, and conduct any future RIFs lawfully. Judge James Bredar ordered the restoration of the employment of the probationary workers whose sudden layoffs harmed Plaintiff States and ordered Defendants to not conduct future RIFs except in compliance with law, but the appeals court blocked his order while the case is on appeal. \nCase Summary: On Feb. 11, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order instructing agency heads to \u201cundertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force (RIFs).\u201d \nPlaintiff States allege that Defendant agencies violated the Administrative Procedure Act by not abiding by the necessary statutory and regulatory requirements for RIF procedures including a required 60-day notice to states and employees; and on ground that the procedures adopted were arbitrary and capricious. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the Defendant agencies to 1) cease the RIFs of probationary employees; 2) reinstate any employees who were fired as part of the mass terminations that followed President Trump\u2019s second inauguration; 3) refrain from separating any employees pursuant to a RIF prior to reinstatement of the unlawfully terminated employees; and 4) conduct any future RIFs in accordance with applicable law, including providing advance notice to States.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 7, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 13, the district court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order. Judge James Kelleher Bredar wrote that the government said \u201cit dismissed each one of these thousands of probationary employees for \u2018performance\u2019 or other individualized reasons. On the record before the Court, this isn't true. There were no individualized assessments of employees. They were all just fired. Collectively.\u201d\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 14, the government filed a notice that it was appealing the TRO to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 20, Plaintiffs filed a motion requesting that the court stay all purported terminations against probationary employees, reinstate all affected employees, and impose a preliminary injunction prohibiting any further reductions in force without following relevant legal requirements.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 21, plaintiffs moved to extend the TRO pending consideration of their motion for a stay and preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 21, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the government\u2019s motion for an administrative stay or a stay pending the resolution of an appeal.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 24, the government filed a motion opposing the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a stay and preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 26, Judge Bredar held a hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 9: On Mar. 26, Judge Bredar ordered the parties to provide additional briefing on the implications of an injunction that was not national in scope by 10 am on Mar. 27.\nUpdate 10: On Mar. 26, the Court extended the TRO that was set to expire on Mar. 27 to expire on Apr. 1 at 8 pm EDT instead.\nUpdate 11: On Mar. 27, the Defendants filed a supplemental briefing pursuant to the Court\u2019s Mar. 26 order, arguing that any preliminary injunction should only apply to affected employees who worked in a Plaintiff State at the time of their removal.\nUpdate 12: On Apr. 1, Judge Bredar granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction and stay in part, noting the actions of the Defendant agencies likely broke the laws regulating mass terminations of government employees. Through this order, the terminations of Affected Probationary Employees on or after Jan. 20, 2025 by Defendants were stayed. Additionally, Defendants were ordered not to conduct future RIFs (unless in compliance with law). \nUpdate 13: On Apr. 2, Defendants appealed the Apr. 1 order to the Fourth Circuit.\nUpdate 14: On Apr. 9, the Fourth Circuit, in a 2-1 decision, issued a stay of the district court order. The majority held that the Government is likely to succeed in showing the Plaintiffs lacked standing, and noted, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has stayed a similar preliminary injunction issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (referring to American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v.

Office of Personnel Management and Ezell (N.D. Cal.)\n\nCase No. 3:25-cv-01780\n(Ninth Circuit Case No. 25-1677)\n\nSupreme Court docket 24A904Complaint (Feb. 19, 2025); Amended Complaint (Feb. 23, 2025)2025-02-19Overview: A group of labor and nonprofit organizations are challenging the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (\u201cOPM\u201d) order to terminate federal employees en masse. The organizations argue that the terminations have falsely cited performance reasons and violate the Constitution and federal law. The organizations also argue that the OPM has violated federal law by sending emails to employees requesting weekly updates on their work; Elon Musk further stated that failure to comply would be considered a resignation. The organizations have asked the court to declare the mass termination unlawful, void the mass termination order, and rescind unlawful terminations made so far. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the mass termination order and ordered the firings to be stopped and rescinded. The government has appealed for the Supreme Court to remove that temporary block.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 13, 2025, the Office of Personnel Management and Acting Director Charles Ezell ordered federal agencies to terminate tens of thousands of probationary employees en masse. Probationary employees are members of the competitive service in their first year of employment or of the excepted service in their first two years of employment, and may also include long-time federal workers who have recently been employed in a new position or a new agency.\nAmong the factual claims, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants sent agencies \u201cstandardized notices of termination, drafted by OPM, that falsely state that the terminations are for performance reasons.\u201d Plaintiffs allege that the mass termination violates multiple requirements under the Administrative Procedure Act and separation of powers principles by overriding Congressional statutes authorizing and regulating agency hiring and firing. They seek a declaration that the mass termination is unlawful and a preliminary or permanent injunction setting aside OPM\u2019s order, ceasing terminations pursuant to the order, and rescinding any prior unlawful terminations.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 23, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging that OPM further violated the APA by sending emails to government employees requesting updates on their week-to-week accomplishments and Musk\u2019s stating that \u201c[f]ailure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\u201d\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 27, Judge William Alsup reportedly ruled from the bench that OPM had no legal authority to issue directives for other  agencies to fire probationary employees. Alsup noted that, due to jurisdictional issues, his order applies only to employees at six agencies (the National Park Service, National Science Foundation, Small Business Administration, Bureau of Land Management, and Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Defense), and that he could not directly order agencies to cease  the firings. As for other agencies not covered, Alsup said, \u201cI am going to count on the government to do the right thing, and to go a little bit further than I have ordered, and to let some of these agencies know what I have ruled.\u201d\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 28, Judge Alsup issued an Opinion and a written Order for a TRO. The Order states that OPM\u2019s memos directing the termination of probationary workers were \u201cunlawful, invalid, and must be stopped and rescinded,\u201d and that OPM must provide written notice of the order to the six agencies.  \nUpdate 4: On Mar. 13, Judge Alsup held a preliminary injunction hearing and, in ruling from the bench, granted and extended the TRO. Alsup directed counsel to file briefs by Mar. 21. \nUpdate 5: On Mar. 13, the Defendants submitted a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 17, the Ninth Circuit denied the government\u2019s request for an administrative stay.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 24, the government filed an application requesting that the U.S. Supreme Court immediately stay the Northern District of California\u2019s preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 24, Judge Alsup issued two orders on the case. In one order, Alsup concluded that the district court does have subject-matter jurisdiction in the case, and therefore reversed the part of his earlier TRO ruling denying relief to plaintiffs. In the second, he ordered the government to show cause that relief should not be extended to plaintiffs by Mar. 28.\nUpdate 9: On Mar. 26, the Ninth Circuit denied Defendants\u2019 emergency motion to stay the preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 10: On Mar. 26, Plaintiffs filed a motion to compel compliance with the preliminary injunction or hold Defendants in contempt, arguing that Defendants have failed to reinstate terminated employees and notify them of the unlawful terminations as ordered by the court on Feb. 27. \nUpdate 11: On Mar. 28, Defendants filed a brief alleging that the District Court lacked jurisdiction and the public-sector union plaintiffs failed to show irreparable harm and thus should not be entitled to additional relief, as ordered to do so by Judge Alsup on Mar. 24. On the same day, Plaintiffs also filed their brief alleging the harm to the public-sector union plaintiffs and requesting a further preliminary injunction for the public-sector union plaintiffs. Plaintiffs requested that Defendants reinstate terminated probationary employees. \nUpdate 12: On Mar. 31, Defendants filed oppositions to both the State of Washington\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction and Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to compel compliance with the Mar. 13 preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs and the State of Washington filed their replies in support of their motions on April 3. \nUpdate 13: On Apr. 4, Defendants filed an additional reply in support of their Mar. 28 brief. Plaintiffs also filed their additional reply brief on the same day.\nUpdate 14: On Mar. 26, one Plaintiff \u2013 the State of Washington \u2013 filed a motion for preliminary injunction, requesting that the court extend prior relief awarded to the class of Plaintiffs to itself, require Defendants to reinstate terminated probationary employees, and order Defendants to cease unlawful terminations.\nUpdate 15: On Apr. 8, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay on the basis of standing. The Court wrote: \u201cThe District Court\u2019s injunction was based solely on the allegations of the nine non-profit-organization plaintiffs in this case. But under established law, those allegations are presently insufficient to support the organizations\u2019 standing. This order does not address the claims of the other plaintiffs, which did not form the basis of the District Court\u2019s preliminary injunction.\u201d\nUpdate 16: On Apr. 11, Defendants filed a memorandum opposing Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, asserting that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are nonjusticiable and that Defendants\u2019 actions are valid exercises of agency discretion.\nUpdate 17: On Apr. 18, Judge Alsup issued an order enjoining further terminations of federal employees under the policies being challenged, and ordering that any employee improperly told they were terminated for performance issues receive written notice rescinding the characterization. Judge Alsup wrote that after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, \u201cadditional plaintiffs have joined the suit and seek additional relief, and an order held that the public-sector labor union plaintiffs have standing to seek provisional relief.\u201d\nUpdate 18: On Apr. 23, Defendants appealed Judge Alsup\u2019s order to the Ninth Circuit.\nUpdate 19: On May 2, Plaintiff filed a motion to relate this case and AFL-CIO v. OPM, No. 3:25-cv-01780-WHA. The motion argues that the two cases arise from a common set of events and risk creating duplicative or conflicting results, including potential Constitutional contradictions.\nUpdate 20: On May 3, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin any issuance or reliance on marginal performance appraisals, prohibit any removal or reassignment based on OMB\u2019s realignment directive, and cease any retaliatory actions against Plaintiff. \nUpdate 21: On May 6, the Defendants filed an opposition to a preliminary injunction, claiming that the two cases at issue are not related, and arguing that the Court should deny the related-case motion and strike the improperly filed preliminary-injunction motion.2025-05-06\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Large-scale reductions in force / Termination of probationary employees (Executive Order 14210)American Federation Of Government Employees, AFL-CIO v.

The district court has temporarily blocked the government's action.\n\nCase Summary: Beginning on Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration initiated various steps to dismantle and reorganize government agencies, including by establishing the Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) and by freezing agency hiring and initiating large-scale reductions in force (RIFs) under Executive Order (EO)14210. Plaintiffs, a coalition of labor organizations, non-profits, and local governments, filed suit, alleging that the EO and actions taken to implement it violate constitutional protections for separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act, as ultra vires and arbitrary and capricious. They seek declaratory judgment that Trump administration actions dismantling and reorganizing government agencies are unlawful and unconstitutional, vacation of EO 14210 and agency guidance implementing the order, and a temporary restraining order and injunction against further implementation of the EO.\nUpdate 1: On May 1, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) which requested that the court block Defendants from taking action to implement or enforce EO 14210.\nUpdate 2: On May 7, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a TRO, asserting Plaintiffs did not establish the immediacy TRO requirement and requesting that the court deny the motion.\nUpdate 3: On May 9, after a hearing. Judge Susan Illston granted a Temporary Restraining Order to pause the Defendants\u2019 reductions in force under EO 14210. Defendants immediately appealed this order to the Ninth Circuit.\nUpdate 4: On May 22, Judge Illston granted a preliminary injunction halting the Trump administration\u2019s implementation of widespread RIFs and agency reorganizations for 22 agencies across the federal government. The court found that neither the president nor the implicated agencies have shown they have the statutory authority to carry out these structural changes without Congressional approval.\nUpdate 5: On May 23, Defendants filed a notice of appeal, appealing to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from the Order Granting Preliminary Injunction.\nUpdate 6: On May 30, the Ninth Circuit denied the Defendants\u2019 motion for a stay. On that same day, the Ninth Circuit granted Defendants\u2019 motion to voluntarily dismiss their appeal of the TRO granted on May 9 in light of the district court\u2019s May 22 preliminary injunction order.\nUpdate 7: On Jun. 2, the government asked the Supreme Court to halt Judge Illston\u2019s ruling limiting mass Reductions in Force (RIFs) at federal agencies.  \nUpdate 8: On June 13, Judge Illson issued an order on the scope of injunctive relief, in which the court held that the State Department\u2019s imminent widespread reductions in force as part of its reorganization plans is barred by the existing injunction.\nUpdate 9: On July 8, in an 8-1 decision, the Supreme Court stayed a preliminary injunction which had blocked the administration from implementing widespread Reduction in Forces (RIFs) and agency reorganizations across 22 agencies. The majority noted that the Executive Order 14210 and related memorandum are likely to be lawful, and found the district court had based its injunction on those directives rather than individual agency plans. They declined to opine as to whether any specific RIFs or reorganization plans may be lawful. Justice Sotomayor concurred to emphasize that the lower court may still review individual agency plans on a case-by-case basis.

Kennedy issued a directive terminating 10,000 Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) employees and closing dozens of agencies controlled by HHS. Plaintiffs are a group of 19 states impacted by the shuttering of HHS departments, led by the State of New York. They allege that the abrupt termination of HHS services has paralyzed the Agency and deprived the public of its Congressionally mandated services.

The committees argue that the EO violates the Federal Election Campaign Act and ask the court to block the EO from being enforced. The district court dismissed the case on June 3.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 18, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order asserting that the Constitution vests all executive authority in the President, arguing that independent regulatory agencies exercise executive functions, and declaring the administration\u2019s policy that such agencies fall under the supervision and control of the President. Such supervision and control requires independent agencies to abide by the President and Attorney General\u2019s interpretations of the law. Plaintiffs, three national committees of the Democratic Party, filed suit as to how the order applies to the Federal Election Commission, an independent regulatory agency. They ask the court under the judicial review provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) to construe as constitutional the provisions of the Act that vest members of the Commission with authority to interpret it (rather than the President); and they argue the order violates the FECA. They seek declaratory judgment that the FECA is constitutional and that the executive order is unlawful as applied to the FEC; and they seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 11, plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, along with a memorandum reasserting that the EO violates FECA and that plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 14, Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi, in their capacities as defendants, filed a motion to dismiss. In an accompanying memorandum, they assert that plaintiffs lack standing to sue and failed to properly state a claim and that the court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the case.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 21, the FEC and its individual commissioners, in their capacities as defendants, filed a motion to dismiss. In an accompanying memorandum, they assert various deficiencies in plaintiffs\u2019 suit, including failure to state a claim and lack of standing, ripeness, and subject-matter jurisdiction.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 25, Trump and Bondi, in their capacities as defendants, filed a memorandum opposing plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a PI, asserting that plaintiffs\u2019 claim lacks standing and ripeness and that plaintiffs have failed to establish imminent irreparable harm.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 25, the FEC and its individual commissioners, in their capacities as defendants, filed a memorandum opposing plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a PI, asserting that plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries are speculative and therefore neither imminent nor irreparable.\nUpdate 6: On April 1, plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for PI reiterating their position that the EO violates FECA and is causing irreparable harm.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 2, plaintiffs filed a consolidated memorandum in opposition to both President Trump\u2019s and Attorney General Bondi\u2019s and the FEC\u2019s motions to dismiss. Plaintiffs argue that they have sufficient standing to bring suit, and that they properly stated claims.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 7, defendants Donald Trump and Pamela Bondi filed a reply memorandum in support of their motion to dismiss, reiterating their allegations that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims lack standing and alleging failure to state a claim for relief.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 7, the FEC filed a reply to the plaintiffs\u2019 response to the FEC\u2019s motion to dismiss, reiterating their allegations that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims lack standing.\nUpdate 10: On Jun. 3, Judge Ali granted the Defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the Plaintiff's lawsuit. \n2025-06-03\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Disclosure of civil servant personnel recordsComans v.

The lawsuit argues that her firing violated the Privacy Act by mishandling her personal information and failing to ensure that her performance review records were accurate. The lawsuit asks the court to declare that DHS\u2019s actions were unlawful and compensation for harm and loss that she suffered from her firing.\n\nCase Summary: On Feb. 11, 2025, plaintiff Mary Comans, a member of the Senior Executive Service serving as the CFO of FEMA, was fired. Her firing was announced in a Department of Homeland Security press release, which stated, \u201cDHS will not sit idly and allow deep state activists to undermine the will and safety of the American people.\u201d Comans filed a complaint alleging that the actions of of the administration violated the Privacy Act by (1) unlawfully disseminating protected information; (2) failing to collect information directly from Comans resulting in adverse determinations concerning her rights; (3) failing to accurately maintain her records; and (4) failure to make reasonable efforts to ensure her records are accurate.

The BIE implemented layoffs that resulted in degraded educational services at federally funded schools.  The lawsuit argues that these actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act, federal laws requiring tribal consultation, and Native students\u2019 rights to quality education and safe school environments. \nCase Summary: The BIE, overseen by the Department of the Interior, implemented layoffs (referred to as \"Reductions in Force\" or \u201cRIF\u201ds) and restructured its operations, resulting in degraded educational services at federally funded schools, including Isleta Elementary School and Haskell Indian Nations University.\nThe plaintiffs, three tribal nations (Pueblo of Isleta, Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, and Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes) and five Native American students sued the Department of the Interior and argued that these actions were arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of agency discretion under the Administrative Procedure Act and violated federal laws requiring tribal consultation under 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2003 and 2011.\nThe plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction to stop further staff reductions and restructuring, as well as a permanent injunction to ensure compliance with tribal consultation requirements and protect educational services for Native students.2025-03-07\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Rescission of Collective Bargaining (Sec.

The unions allege that the Defendants engaged in an unlawful and unilateral termination of a negotiated union contract that protects approximately 47,000 Transportation Security Officers (TSOs).The court has preliminarily blocked the government\u2019s action. \nCase Summary: Case Summary: On Mar. 7, DHS announced it was \u201cending collective bargaining for the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Transportation Security Officers.\u201d The action was taken pursuant to Sec. Noem\u2019s memorandum of Feb. 27, 2025.\nOn Mar. 13, 2025, a coalition of unions, including the AFGE, AFGE TSA Local 1121, the Communications Workers of America (\u201cCWA\u201d), and the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (\u201cAFA-CWA\u201d) sued the Noem, the DHS, the TSA, and Stahl. \nThe plaintiffs argue that the Trump administration\u2019s termination of a negotiated union contract that protects approximately 47,000 TSOs (1) constitute unconstitutional retaliation against AFGE for exercising its right to advocate for federal workers, (2) violate Fifth Amendment due process, and (3) violate the Administrative Procedure Act.\nThe plaintiffs seek immediate injunctive relief to prevent the administration from rescinding the existing contract, eliminating union representation, and stripping workers of their bargaining rights.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 4, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that they are highly likely to succeed on the merits, face irreparable harm, and the balance of equities and public interest supports injunctive relief.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 25, the Defendants filed a response to the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On May 2, the Plaintiffs filed a reply in further support of their motion for a preliminary injunction, urging the court to grant the injunction to halt Defendants\u2019 alleged efforts to punish AFGE from exercising its First Amendment rights.\nUpdate 4: On Jun. 2, Judge Pechman issued a preliminary injunction blocking DHS secretary Kristi Noem from ending collective bargaining rights and rescinding the 2024 union contract for Transportation Security Officers, finding that the action was likely retaliatory, violated due process, and arbitrary and capricious.\n2025-06-02\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Rescission of Collective Bargaining (Sec.

NTEU has asked the court to block termination of these agreements, which the court did on Apr. 25. But the appeals court blocked that order while the case is appealed. \nCase Summary: On Mar. 27, President Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) that terminated certain federal employees\u2019 collective bargaining agreements, including nearly one dozen agreements negotiated by National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), a labor union representing federal workers.\nNTEU is bringing this suit against the President and the heads of certain NTEU-represented agencies, claiming that the EO will drastically reduce the number of employees it represents, diminishing the dues NTEU can collect and its influence at the bargaining table. NTEU alleges that the EO is unlawful and ultra vires on the ground that it conflicts with federal statutes (including on collective bargaining, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103(b)(1)), and violates NTEU\u2019s First Amendment rights. NTEU asks the court to declare that the EO and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Guidance on the EO are unlawful and to enjoin all defendants other than Trump from implementing the EO and the OPM guidance on the EO.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 4, NTEU filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin Section 2 of the Executive Order and the OPM guidance on the EO.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 11, the defendants filed a response to the motion for a preliminary injunction, alleging that the plaintiff cannot show irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction, is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its claims, and that the balance of equities and the public interest favor the government. \nUpdate 3: On Apr. 16th, the NTEU filed a reply in support of its motion for a preliminary injunction, refuting the claims set forth by the defendants in their response to the motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 25, the court granted a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 29, defendants appealed the court\u2019s Apr. 25 preliminary injunction order to the D.C. Circuit.\nUpdate 6: On May 16, the DC Circuit, in a 2-1 decision, granted the Defendants\u2019 a stay pending appeal.\n2025-05-16\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Rescission of Collective Bargaining (Sec.

They argue that the EO and its implementation violate the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the Separation of Powers.The district court has blocked the federal agencies from implementing the EO against the unions and their employees. The federal agencies have since appealed this block to the Ninth Circuit, which issued a temporary suspension of the district court order while the issue is on appeal. \nCase Summary: On Mar. 27, President Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) that terminated certain federal employees\u2019 collective bargaining agreements.\nA number of unions representing federal employees that lost collective bargaining protections filed suit against President Donald Trump and numerous federal agencies at which the unionized employees work. The Plaintiffs argue that the EO violates the First Amendment because it was issued in retaliation for the Plaintiffs\u2019 filing of lawsuits challenging various Trump Administration actions and because it constitutes viewpoint discrimination. The Plaintiffs also challenge the EO is ultra vires on the ground that it violates the federal statute that created the collective bargaining system and would therefore violate the separation of powers. They additionally argue that the EO violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Procedural Due Process Clause, Takings Clause, and Equal Protection Clause. The Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief finding that the EO and its implementation violate the Constitution as alleged and prohibiting the Defendants from giving effect to the EO.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 7, Plaintiffs filed an Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause. The TRO sought would enjoin the implementation of the EO.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 25, Defendants filed an Opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 Ex Parte Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Order to Show Cause. The Defendants allege that the Plaintiffs do not establish irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction, cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits, and that the balance of equities and the public interest weigh against the Plaintiffs.\nUpdate 3: On June 24, Judge James Donato granted Plaintiffs a preliminary injunction, which enjoined the Agency Defendants and the Agency Head Defendants from implementing the EO against Plaintiffs and their members.\nUpdate 4: On June 26, Defendants appealed Judge Donato\u2019s preliminary injunction order to the Ninth Circuit.\nUpdate 5: On July 7, the Ninth Circuit granted an administrative stay while the litigation proceeds.2025-07-07\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Rescission of Collective Bargaining (Sec.

Trump \n\nCase No.1:25-cv-01030Complaint2025-04-07Overview:  The American Foreign Service Association (\u201cAFSA\u201d) sued to block President Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Order (\u201cEO\u201d) terminating the collective bargaining rights of members of the U.S. Foreign Service, arguing that the termination of AFSA\u2019s collective bargaining rights was not for national security reasons and instead was in retaliation to AFSA\u2019s opposition to other actions taken by Trump. The district court has placed a temporary hold on the government's action.\nCase Summary: On March 27, 2025, Trump issued EO 14251 which invoked \u00a7 4103(b) of the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute to terminate the collective bargaining rights of all the Foreign Service members employed by the U.S. State Department and USAID. AFSA \u2013 a professional association that represents approximately 18,000 members of the Foreign Service - asserted that the Trump administration exceeded its authority under the Foreign Service Labor-Management Relations Statute by terminating AFSA\u2019s collective bargaining rights for non-national security reasons. AFSA also alleged that its First Amendment rights have been violated, asserting that the EO retaliates against AFSA for opposing other actions taken by the Trump administration. The plaintiff sued, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, to enjoin the Trump administration from enforcing the EO.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 14, AFSA filed a motion for a preliminary injunction in which it requested the Court to enjoin the application of the EO and OPM\u2019s guidance on the order.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 25, the Trump Administration filed its opposition to AFSA\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On May 14, Judge Paul Friedman granted a preliminary injunction.\n2025-05-14\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Rescission of Collective Bargaining (Sec.

Department of Defense (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01070Complaint2025-04-09Overview:  North America\u2019s Building Trade Unions are challenging the legality of memorandums issued by the Department of Defense and the General Services Administration, which remove requirements for the use of project labor agreements (PLAs) in large-scale construction projects and which they allege violate an existing Executive Order requiring their use. \nCase Summary: On February 7, 2025, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a memorandum directing that contracting officers shall not use project labor agreements (PLAs), which are pre-hire agreements which set workplace policies before construction begins, for large-scale construction projects, and shall amend solicitations to remove PLA requirements. On February 12, 2025, the General Services Administration (GSA) issued a similar memorandum.  These memorandums\u2019 directions stand in contrast with Executive Order (EO) 14063, an existing Biden order which requires that agencies use PLAs on large-scale construction projects, with case-by-case exceptions. Plaintiffs, North America\u2019s Building Trade Unions and its affiliated chartered building and construction trades councils, allege irreparable harm as they enter into and are signatory to many PLAs each year with the DOD and GSA and assert that they are losing project mandates due to the agencies\u2019 noncompliance with the EO. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants\u2019 actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act as contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious, and seek declaratory and injunctive relief.\nUpdate 1: On May 16, the Court granted Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. In its accompanying memorandum, the Court noted that they were vacating the memoranda in question and that the ruling did not apply only to the named plaintiffs. 2025-05-16\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Changes to Social Security AdministrationAmerican Association of People With Disabilities v. Dudek (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00977Complaint2025-04-02Overview:  Disability rights organizations and individuals with disabilities who receive government benefits have sued the Social Security Administration (SAA), Department of Government Efficiency Service (DOGE), and the leaders of these two organizations for their roles in reducing SAA\u2019s workforce, ability to operate, and ability to provide access to SAA benefits and services by telephone, which disproportionately impacts people with disabilities who rely on telephone-based services. These organizations and individuals allege violations of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Constitution, and Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The court has ordered SAA and DOGE to temporarily revoke their actions and cease from making additional workforce changes until they can ensure such changes will not impact Plaintiffs\u2019 access to services.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order No. 14158 establishing the Department of Government Efficiency Service (DOGE), which is allegedly led by Elon Musk. Under the direction of Defendants Musk and DOGE, the Social Security Administration (SAA) has eliminated two offices that enable it to meet the needs of beneficiaries with disabilities: the Office of Civil Rights and Equal Opportunity (OCREO) and the Office of Transformation. SAA\u2019s workforce has also been significantly reduced, which is impacting its ability to provide its beneficiaries of essential services, and SSA has eliminated the ability of many beneficiaries to use the telephone to, among other things, file benefit claims. Plaintiffs are disability rights organizations and individuals with disabilities, including older adults, who depend on Social Security benefits to meet their most basic and essential needs. They are suing the SAA, DOGE, and the leaders of these two organizations for their roles in dismantling and reducing the SAA workforce. Plaintiffs allege the government\u2019s actions constitute violations of Section 504(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Fifth Amendment procedural due process, the First Amendment right to petition the government, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (specifically, claiming that these actions are arbitrary and capricious, in excess of statutory authority, not in accordance with law, and unlawfully withheld). Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to halt the restrictions on access to SSA benefits and ensure SAA is compelled to fulfill its statutory duties following the dismantling of its workforce. \nUpdate 1: Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction requesting that the Court order SSA and DOGE to revoke their actions and prevent these agencies from making additional workforce changes until they can ensure such changes will not impact Plaintiffs\u2019 access to services.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 3, the Court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction without issuing a full opinion due to the expedited nature of the matter.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 16, SSA and DOGE filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. These agencies argue that Plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims, the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the claims, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims fail on the merits, and that the SSA\u2019s administrative reforms were adequately explained and subject to agency discretion.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 21, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction in which they note SSA and DOGE provide no evidence of widespread fraud to justify their overhaul of the SSA.\nUpdate 5: On May 6, the Court issued an order denying the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction because the Plaintiffs had not demonstrated irreparable harm.2025-05-06\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Museums and Public Libraries (Executive Order 14238 - Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy)State of Rhode Island v.

The attorneys general of 21 states sued, alleging that the actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act as arbitrary and capricious, contrary to constitutional rights and contrary to law as it violates the notice-and-comments requirements, the Constitution\u2019s Take Care Clause, Appropriations Clause, and separation of powers protections as well as the Impoundment Control Act by seeking to eliminate agencies without Congressional action. They seek to have the administration\u2019s actions declared unlawful and unconstitutional and the issuance of preliminary and permanent injunctions reversing the steps taken to eliminate the agencies and preventing further such actions.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 4, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent Defendants from implementing Executive Order 14,238 as it relates to the IMLS, MBDA, and FMCS, pending review of the case on the merits.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 9, Plaintiffs and Defendants jointly filed a stipulation converting Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a TRO to a motion for a preliminary injunction and setting a timeline for further responses to the motion.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 14, Defendants filed a memorandum opposing Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for an emergency TRO, asserting that Plaintiffs failed to show a likelihood of success on any of their claims.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 16, Plaintiffs filed a reply supporting their motion for a preliminary injunction, reasserting that Defendants\u2019 actions in closing the agencies violated the APA and Constitutional separation-of-powers provisions.\nUpdate 5: On May 6, Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 6: On Jun. 12, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. 2025-06-12\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Museums and Public Libraries (Executive Order 14238 - Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy)American Library Association v.

They argue that the EO violates Constitutional limits on presidential authority and the Administrative Procedure Act. The court has temporarily blocked the government\u2019s action.The court first temporarily blocked the government\u2019s action, but subsequently held it likely did not have jurisdiction and the case should be brought in a different court.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 14, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14238, \u201cContinuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy,\u201d which calls for the elimination of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) and instructs the agency to \u201creduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law\u201d while instructing the Office of Management and Budget to reject funding requests from the agency. Following the promulgation of the EO, employees from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) terminated nearly all of IMLS\u2019s staff and began canceling grants, while Acting IMLS Director Keith Sonderling fired all 23 members of the National Museum and Library Services Board. Plaintiffs, including a nonprofit membership organization promoting library access and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, allege that the actions violate the Constitution\u2019s Take Care Clause and separation of powers protections by seeking to eliminate agencies without Congressional action, the First Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act as arbitrary and capricious and in violation of the Impoundment Control Act, the Appropriations Act, and MLSA \u00a7203 (a) which established IMLS as an independent agency.. They seek to have the administration\u2019s actions declared unlawful and unconstitutional and the issuance of preliminary and permanent injunctions reversing the steps taken to eliminate the IMLS and preventing further such actions. \nUpdate 1: On Apr. 10, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction directing Defendants to cease actions taken to dissolve the IMLS while the court considers the case. Plaintiffs also filed a memorandum in support of their motion reasserting their arguments that the administration\u2019s actions toward IMLS violate the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act. \nUpdate 2: On Apr. 21, Defendants filed an opposition brief to Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction arguing that Plaintiffs lack standing, that their claims should be heard in a different court or administrative body, and that Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their statutory and constitutional claims.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 28, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of a preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs argued that they have standing, have filed their claims in the right court, and that they have shown a likelihood of success on the merits for their statutory and constitutional claims.\nUpdate 4: On May 1, Judge Richard Leon granted a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 5: On Jun. 6, Judge Leon denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, holding that his court likely did not have jurisdiction and the case should instead be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. 2025-06-06\n\n\nStructure of Government/PersonnelExecutive Action: Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (Executive Order 14238 - Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy)American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO v.

Following the promulgation of the EO and the promulgation of a plan imposing less drastic cuts by FMCS, employees from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) terminated nearly all of FMCS\u2019s staff. On Apr. 14, a group of unions filed suit against the FMCS, the United States, the OMB and associated officials, arguing that the government is violating the separation of powers; acts in excess of statutory authority; and is arbitrary and capricious, and has unlawfully withheld required agency action, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The plaintiffs seek to have the court find the EO unlawful as it applies to FMCS, issue a preliminary and permanent injunction and return the agency to its status prior to the EO, declare the dismantling of FMCS as violative of the Administrative Procedure Act, and compel FMCS to resume providing the mediation services it provided prior to the EO.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 16, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and supporting memorandum in which they requested an order to block Defendants from dismantling FMCS and to restore the status quo ante.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 24, Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction.

Office of Management and Budget (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00239-LLAComplaint2025-01-28Overview: Small business and nonprofit recipients of federal funds sued the Office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d), challenging their memo requiring every federal agency to pause any activities related to President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders (\u201cEOs\u201d). The plaintiffs argue that OMB\u2019s memo violates the Constitution and federal law, and exceeds the scope of its authority. The plaintiffs have asked the court to declare the memo unlawful and unconstitutional, and stop the OMB from implementing or enforcing its memo. After the court temporarily stopped OMB from implementing the memo, OMB rescinded its memo but issued a statement that the underlying EOs on freezing federal funding was still in effect and would be implemented. The court subsequently issued a temporary block on OMB from implementing the funding freeze. On February 11, the plaintiffs requested the block be extended for the duration of the lawsuit and on February 25, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 request. OMB has since appealed the February 25 court order to the D.C. Circuit.\nCase Summary: The Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget issued a memorandum purported to \u201crequire every federal agency to temporarily pause\u201d any agency activities \u201cthat may be implicated by [President Trump\u2019s] executive orders.\u201d The plaintiff organizations, represented by Democracy Forward, are small businesses and nonprofits that receive federal funds.

On the same day, the White House Press Secretary stated, \u201cThis is not a rescission of the federal funding freeze. It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo. Why? To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The President's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented.\u201d\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 3, 2025, Judge Alikhan issued a temporary restraining order blocking the OMB from implementing its funding freeze, finding that the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the directive was arbitrary and capricious under the APA, and that the post-complaint rescission of the memorandum was \u201cdisingenuous\u201d  and still causing irreparable injury. The order directed the OMB to release the frozen funds, notify agencies of this TRO, and file a status report on compliance by Feb. 7, 2025.\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 11, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the Trump Administration from reinstating the funding freeze. The Government filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion, and plaintiffs replied. The hearing was held on Feb. 20.\nUpdate 5: On Feb. 25, the court issued a memorandum opinion and granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the Trump administration from implementing, giving effect to, or reinstating under a different name the blanket freeze on disbursement of Federal funds. \nUpdate 6: On Apr. 14, the Defendants filed an answer to the Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, responding paragraph-by-paragraph to the Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations and claiming that the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims, the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and the relief that Plaintiffs seek is barred by sovereign immunity and not available under the APA. \nUpdate 7: On Apr. 24, Defendants appealed the Feb. 25 preliminary injunction order to the D.C.

While the OMB later rescinded the memo referred to in the states\u2019 complaint, the federal courts since then have ruled that the Trump Administration should release the funding freeze. The Trump Administration has appealed the Rhode Island District Court\u2019s grant of a preliminary injunction and its subsequent ruling enforcing the preliminary injunction to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.\nCase Summary: The Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget issued a memorandum purported to \u201crequire every federal agency to temporarily pause\u201d any agency activities \u201cthat may be implicated by [President Trump\u2019s] executive orders.\u201d The attorneys general of 22 states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions against enforcement of the policy.

Judge McConnell\u2019s order notes that the case is not moot because \u201cthe alleged rescission of the OMB Directive was in name only and may have been issued simply to defeat the jurisdiction of the courts.\u201d The judge also wrote, \"the States are likely to succeed on the merits of some, if not all, their claims.\" \nUpdate 4: On Feb. 10, Judge McConnell granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to enforce the temporary restraining order. Judge McConnell noted the Plaintiff States presented evidence suggesting that Defendants \u201chave continued to improperly freeze federal funds and refused to resume disbursement of appropriated federal funds\u201d (citing three exhibits). Judge McConnell emphasized that this is a violation of the TRO and ordered Defendants to immediately restore frozen funding.\nUpdate 5: On Feb. 14, the First Circuit issued a voluntary dismissal of defendants\u2019 motion to appeal the decision. \nUpdate 6: On Mar. 6, Judge McConnell granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. Defendants were enjoined from in any way impeding the disbursement of appropriated federal funds to the states.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 10, the defendants filed a notice of appeal of the preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 24, the plaintiffs filed a renewed second motion to enforce the Court\u2019s preliminary injunction order entered on Mar. 6 as it pertains to the freezing of FEMA funds, claiming that the plaintiff states have continued to experience significant obstacles to accessing federal funds despite the Court\u2019s order.\nUpdate 9: On Mar. 26, the First Circuit denied defendants\u2019 motion for a stay pending the appeal of the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction order. The First Circuit noted defendants did not meet their burden of proof in their motion.\nUpdate 10: On Mar. 27, defendants filed their opposition to plaintiffs' renewed second motion to enforce the Court\u2019s preliminary injunction order on Mar. 6 as it pertains to the freezing of FEMA funds. Defendants argue the manual review process delaying the payment of FEMA funds is not equivalent to a pause or freeze of funds and is accordingly compliant with the district court\u2019s preliminary injunction order.\nUpdate 11: On Mar. 31, plaintiffs filed their reply in support of renewed second motion to enforce the preliminary injunction, offering new facts regarding FEMA\u2019s manual review of grant programs and requesting that FEMA be ordered to halt its funding freeze.\nUpdate 12: On Apr. 4, Judge McConnell held that the government was not in compliance with the preliminary injunction. \u201cFEMA's manual review process violates the Court's preliminary injunction order,\u201d the court wrote with instructions to cease the manual review process.\nUpdate 13: On Apr. 28, Defendants appealed the Apr. 4 order enforcing the preliminary injunction to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.2025-04-28\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: \u201cTemporary Pause\u201d of grants, loans, and assistance programsShapiro et al. v.

Pa.)\n\nCase No. 2:25-cv-00763\nComplaint2025-02-13Overview: Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and several Pennsylvania state departments sued the Trump Administration over a funding freeze implicating billions in already committed federal funds. The lawsuit alleges violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution, seeking to restore the suspended funding.\nCase Summary: The Plaintiffs\u2014Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and four Pennsylvania governmental departments\u2014allege that five Executive Orders and a subsequent OMB Directive froze funds already appropriated to various departments and projects in Pennsylvania. The complaint describes five different communications from EPA, HHS, and DOE after the Jan. 27 OMB Directive. None of these communications identified specific programs or funds that would be terminated, and none cited any legal authority. Much of this funding was appropriated under either the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) or the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The plaintiffs allege that, in total, the funding freeze jeopardizes at least $5.5 billion that had been committed to Pennsylvania, and over $1 billion of which had already been obligated. The plaintiffs note the ongoing litigation on the funding freeze, but they claim that, despite the court action \u2013 Jan. 31 TRO (D.R.I.), the Feb. 3 TRO (D.D.C.), the Feb. 7 motion to enforce the TRO (D.R.I.), and the Feb. 11 denial of the defendants\u2019 motion for an administrative stay (1st Cir.) \u2013 as of Feb. 13, over $1.2 billion in grant funding is suspended and more than $900 million is marked as requiring further federal review before being approved. Plaintiffs claim that defendants\u2019 actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act because they are contrary to law (contrary to the IRA and the IIJA) and are arbitrary and capricious.

Federal Emergency Management Agency (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00740Complaint2025-03-13Overview: The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a DC-based nonprofit that manages the federal government\u2019s investment in public broadcasting, brought a suit against the FEMA for placing a hold on congressionally appropriated funds intended for the national emergency weather alert system. The nonprofit is seeking to block the hold and to prevent FEMA from interfering with any grant payments. On Mar. 17, a federal judge denied the nonprofit\u2019s request for a temporary block while the case proceeds.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 19, 2025, FEMA placed a hold on grant funds that are due and owed under a grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and FEMA to the Plaintiff relating to the Next Generation Warning System (NGWS) for the nation\u2019s emergency alert system. FEMA has not identified any reason for this hold. Plaintiff claims that FEMA\u2019s failure to allow CPB to submit reimbursements and receive payments owed to 42 sub-awardee public media stations, which have committed funds to purchase critical equipment for NGWS program upgrades and enhancements, is arbitrary and unlawful. Plaintiffs bring the suit under the Administrative Procedure Act arguing the government conduct is arbitrary and capricious, and they seek a TRO and preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 1: Plaintiff filed a motion for a TRO on Mar. 13, 2025.

Trump et al. (S.D.N.Y.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01510 Complaint2025-02-21Overview: New York City sued the Trump Administration after the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\u201cFEMA\u201d) unexpectedly clawed back $80 million in previously approved migrant housing funds. The City argues that the action violates federal rules and terms and conditions, and severely harms the City. The City has asked the court to declare that FEMA\u2019s actions were unlawful and require FEMA return the funds to the City.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 11, 2025, FEMA clawed back $80 million that it had disbursed to New York City one week earlier. The funds had previously been approved by FEMA as reimbursement under the Shelter and Services Programs (SSP) to offset the City\u2019s costs of providing housing and services for noncitizen migrants. Plaintiff alleges that FEMA had \u201creviewed and approved the City\u2019s request [for funds], and issued payment, [and yet] Defendants grabbed the money back without any administrative process whatsoever.\u201d The complaint alleges that Defendants attempted to cloak their actions \u201cwith a veneer of administrative process,\u201d including by issuing a \u201cnoncompliance\u201d letter to the City\u2019s Office of Management and Budget with \u201cFindings\u201d that SSP funds were being used for \u201cillegal activities.\u201d Plaintiff alleges that the noncompliance letter was pretextual  and that Defendants\u2019 \u201creal intent \u2026 is to withhold the funds permanently because they oppose the purposes for which the funds were appropriated, awarded, approved, and paid.\u201d Plaintiff sues for injunctive relief to compel Defendants to return the funds to the City. Plaintiff also seeks a declaration that Defendants\u2019 actions are arbitrary and capricious, in excess of authority, and without observance of lawful procedures.In the interim, Plaintiff seeks a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction ordering Defendants to return certain funds and to enjoin Defendants from taking further relevant grant money from the City.\n\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 28, Defendants filed a memorandum of law in opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 3, Plaintiffs filed a reply memorandum of law in further support of the motion for preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 20, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint (redline here).\nUpdate 4: On Jun. 16, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint (redline here). 2025-06-16\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsClimate United Fund v. Citibank (D.D.C.) \n\nCase No. 1:24-cv-00698 Complaint2025-03-08Overview: : Climate United Fund, a nonprofit with grant funding from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), has brought a suit against the EPA and Citibank for the withholding of grant funds. The EPA ordered Citibank to freeze the funds, and Citibank is now withholding the funds, effectively terminating Climate United Fund\u2019s grant. A federal judge has temporarily granted a limited block preventing the EPA and Citibank from implementing the grant termination and transferring the funds elsewhere. This case has been consolidated with multiple other cases and the judge\u2019s decision has been appealed to a higher court.\nCase Summary: Plaintiff Climate United Fund has brought suit against the EPA and Citibank for the withholding of its grant funding obtained from the EPA in 2024 through the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), a program under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF). The grant requires Climate United\u2019s grant funds to be held at Citibank under a Financial Agent Agreement (FAA) between Citibank and the U.S. Treasury Department, and an Account Control Agreement (ACA) between Citibank, Climate \nUnited, and EPA that sets forth the specific details for EPA to exercise \u201ccontrol\u201d as a secured party. On Feb. 12, 2025, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made a public statement announcing EPA\u2019s goal of taking back grant funds disbursed to Climate United Fund and other recipients pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA and Zeldin then started to take multiple actions designed to suspend or terminate Climate United\u2019s grant. Citibank is now refusing to honor Climate United\u2019s disbursement requests despite contractual obligation to do so, citing the need for further direction from the EPA before disbursing any grant funds. Climate United Fund has been forced to defer compensation for some employees and will shortly run out of funds to pay operating expenses. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to order Citibank to disburse funds, enjoin the EPA and Zeldin from impeding Citibank from disbursing funds, and enjoin the EPA and Zeldin from unlawfully suspending or terminating Climate United\u2019s grant award. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 10, Plaintiff filed a motion requesting a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d). On Mar. 12, both Citibank and the EPA filed motions in opposition to the TRO. \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 11, the EPA terminated Climate United Fund\u2019s grant. On Mar. 17, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint to include the unlawful termination of the grant. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 18, Judge Tanya Chutkan granted in part and denied in part Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a TRO, enjoining the EPA and Citibank from implementing the grant termination and transferring the funds elsewhere. \nUpdate 4: On Mar. 21, Plaintiffs filed a consolidated motion for a preliminary injunction to request that the Court prevent the Federal Defendants from (1) effectuating the EPA\u2019s Mar. 11 termination of Climate United Fund\u2019s grant, (2) unlawfully limiting access to the funds related to Plaintiffs\u2019 grants, and (3) impeding Citibanks\u2019 access to funds related to the grants.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 26, the Federal Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 consolidated motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 28, Plaintiff filed a reply in support of Plaintiffs\u2019 consolidated motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 31, the Federal Defendants filed an opposition to the Subgrantee Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction.\nOn that same day,  Judge Chutkan ordered the extension of the TRO. \nUpdate 8: On Apr. 8, Judge Chutkan ordered the extension of the Mar. 18 TRO for another 7 days. \nUpdate 9: On Apr. 15, the Federal Defendants filed a contingent emergency motion requesting a stay pending the appeal to the D.C. Circuit of any order or preliminary injunction that requires the disbursement of federal funds from the Citibank accounts. On the same day, Plaintiffs responses (here, here, and here) in opposition to the contingent emergency motion. \nUpdate 10: On Apr. 15, this case was consolidated with the suits against Defendants of other nonprofit plaintiffs who were also National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) grantees.\nUpdate 11: On Apr. 15, Judge Chutkan granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction and denied Defendants\u2019 contingent emergency motion requesting a stay pending appeal, ordering that the Federal Defendants are prevented from unlawfully suspending or terminating Plaintiffs\u2019 grants and impeding Citibank from disbursing funds for the grants, and that Citibank is prevented from transferring or otherwise moving funds from accounts related to the grants and must disburse funds incurred before the mid-February suspension of disbursement. On Apr. 16, Judge Chutkan published a memorandum opinion in conjunction with the order granting the preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 12: On Apr. 16, the EPA filed a notice of appeal of the Apr. 15 preliminary injunction to the D.C. Circuit. \nUpdate 13: On Apr. 17, Plaintiffs Climate United Fund, Coalition for Green Capital, \nand Power Forward Communities filed a motion requesting the District Court to clarify the obligations imposed on Citibank by the Apr. 15 preliminary injunction and to amend the time period of funds to be disbursed. \nUpdate 14: On Apr. 18, the Federal Defendants filed a response, arguing that the pending appeal prevents the District Court from having the authority to grant Plaintiffs\u2019 request. \nUpdate 15: On Apr. 19, Judge Chutkan granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to clarify and amend the Apr. 15 preliminary injunction.2025-04-19\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsMassachusetts Fair Housing Center v. Department of Housing and Urban Development (D. Mass)\n\nCase No. 3:25-cv-30041Complaint2025-02-19Overview:: A group of non-profit fair housing organizations brought a lawsuit against the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for the termination of Fair Housing Initiative Program (FHIP) grant funds. At the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), HUD terminated the funds without notice. The fair housing organizations asked the court to permanently or at least temporarily reinstate the terminated FHIP grants and prevent further terminations. On Mar. 26, the court temporarily reinstated the relevant FHIP grants and temporarily blocked further terminations, however these actions were later dissolved by the court following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Dep\u2019t of Education v. California. The fair housing organizations have appealed the court\u2019s decision to dissolve its temporary orders.\nCase Summary: At the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Executive Order (EO) 14158, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) terminated 78 Fair Housing Initiative Program (FHIP) grants on February 27, 2025. The Plaintiffs to this class action are several non-profit fair housing organizations whose FHIP grants were terminated. FHIP grants are congressionally-appropriated funds, and the termination of the FHIP grants impacts the fair housing initiatives in 33 states and has resulted in the halt of programming to groups protected by the Fair Housing Act (FHA). HUD terminated these grants on the basis that they  \u201cno longer effectuate[] the program goals or agency priorities,\u201d which Plaintiffs allege constitutes an arbitrary, capricious, and unlawful action by HUD and an ultra vires action by DOGE. Plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief to reinstate the terminated grants.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 13, the same day the complaint was filed, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO).\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 21, defendants filed an opposition to plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion for a TRO.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 24, plaintiffs filed a reply in support of its emergency motion for a TRO updating its motion to seek preliminary relief against the HUD defendants only.\nUpdate 4:  On Mar. 26, following a hearing the day prior, the court granted the motion for an emergency TRO to temporarily enjoin the HUD defendants from terminating relevant FHIP grants and to reinstate those already terminated.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 7, Defendants filed a motion to dissolve the emergency TRO following the Supreme Court\u2019s grant of emergency relief in Dep\u2019t of Education v. California, in which the Court found the government defendants were likely to succeed in dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction. Defendants also argued in their memorandum that the district court should stay proceedings. On Apr. 11, Plaintiffs filed an opposition to this motion to dissolve and stay proceedings, however Judge Stearns granted Defendants\u2019 motion on Apr. 14. The court stated that it \u201cwas \u201cmerely deferring (as it must) to the Supreme Court\u2019s unmistakable directive that, for jurisdictional purposes, the proper forum for this case is the Court of Federal Claims.\u201d\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 16, Plaintiffs appealed Judge Stearns\u2019 Apr. 14 order granting Defendants\u2019 motion to dissolve the emergency TRO to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.2025-04-16\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsAmerican Public Health Association v. National Institutes of Health (D. Mass.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-10787Complaint2025-04-02Overview: In February 2025 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) terminated various grants for biomedical and behavioural research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and ceased considering certain categories of pending grant applications. On April 2, a group of leading health research organisations and research scientists sued the NIH; Jay Bhattacharya, the Director of the NIH; HHS; and Robert F. Kennedy, Secretary of HHS alleging that these terminations are unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and for the court to halt the government\u2019s actions.  The district court found Defendants actions violated the APA as final agency actions that are unlawful, a decision which was immediately appealed by Defendants.\nCase Summary: After President Trump issued Executive Orders 14151 and 14173, directing that federal funds should not be used to promote \u201cgender ideology\u201d or DEI,  the NIH issued a series of documents articulating areas of research that \u201cno longer effectuate[] agency priorities\u201d (the \u201cDirectives\u201d) and labelling certain topics of research, including DEI, transgender issues, vaccine hesitancy, and Covid, as forbidden topics. The NIH have allegedly subsequently terminated at least 678 research projects on a wide range of public health issues. \nPlaintiffs consist of four researchers who have either lost funding for grants or have had an application for a grant not considered, as well as the American Public Health Association (APHA), whose members have had grants canceled and whose journal is funded by the NIH; the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) which represents many academic workers and graduate students who have had grants terminated, and Ibis Reproductive Health, which also had a grant terminated. \nThe complaint alleges that the NIH violated the APA in several ways: the terminations are \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d; were not in accordance with law, in particular 2 C.F.R. \u00a7200.340 (b) (2020), as they include no evidence as to why the grants were terminated; exceeded statutory authority as the congressional mandates specifically encourage studies involving diverse populations; and violated constitutional rights because of their failure to  properly consider applications. Plaintiffs also allege that the vagueness of the criteria used for the terminations violates Fifth Amendment due process protections.\nPlaintiffs seek to have the terminations declared unlawful and both temporary and permanently enjoined, order NIH to restore grant awards, and order them to review all properly submitted applications.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 25, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to block Defendants from implementing the EOs, along with a memorandum of law supporting the motion.\nUpdate 2: On May 12, Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction, claiming that the Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits, they are not certain, imminent, and irreparable, and an injunction would be contrary to the public interest.\nUpdate 3: Judge William Young collapsed the motion for a preliminary injunction into a motion to dismiss and, on May 30, granted the Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss three counts but denied the motion to dismiss on all other counts.\nUpdate 4: On June 16, Judge Young reportedly found that the administration\u2019s termination of certain NIH research grants\u2014particularly those focused on gender, diversity, equity, and inclusion\u2014was unlawful and discriminatory. \nUpdate 5: On June 23, Judge Young granted partial summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and held the challenged Directives and resulting grant terminations were arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA. On that same day, Defendants appealed Judge Young\u2019s order and partial final judgment to the First Circuit.2025-06-23\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsCommonwealth of Massachusetts v. Kennedy (D. Mass.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-10814Complaint2025-04-04Overview:  A coalition of 16 states filed suit against the National Institutes of Health (NIH) challenging the NIH\u2019s delays in reviewing NIH grant applications as well as the termination of hundreds of already-issued grants. The plaintiffs allege that these delays and terminations are unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act and seek injunctive relief to compel review of applications and to block the NIH from terminating previously approved grants.\nCase Summary: Following President Trump\u2019s issuance of Executive Orders 14151, 14168 and 14173, which directed that federal funds should not be used to promote \u201cgender ideology\u201d or DEI, federal agencies issued policy directives implementing the executive orders at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\nOn Apr. 4, 2025 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the attorneys general of 15 additional states sued the NIH and various institutes and centers administered by the NIH, as well as NIH director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS), and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for failure to properly review or administer NIH grants and grant renewals.\nPlaintiffs allege that since January, all upcoming meetings for NIH grant applications by the two NIH bodies who review grants (a group of subject matter experts and an advisory council that considers funding availability and agency priorities) have been cancelled and that scheduling of future meetings has been delayed and minimized. In addition, they claim that the NIH has indefinitely withheld issuing final decisions on applications that have already received approval from these review bodies, including grant renewals, and that the NIH has terminated large numbers of already-issued grants for projects deemed to be connected to certain topics, including DEI, transgender issues, and vaccine hesitancy, in response to Executive Orders 14151, 14168 and 14173. These grants were terminated on the basis that they \u201cno longer effectuate[] agency priorities\u201d. \nPlaintiffs argue that the actions by the NIH violate the APA as they are both contrary to NIH regulations and statutes and \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d, and that they also violate the Separation of Powers and Spending Clauses of the Constitution. They allege that these delays and terminations have caused significant harm to public research institutions within their states and are seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction compelling the defendants to review delayed applications and barring them from carrying out terminations of grants.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 14, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction (along with a memorandum of law)  seeking to block Defendants from implementing policy directives issued pursuant to the EOs at issue.\nUpdate 2: On May 1, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction motion. Among its arguments in opposition, Defendants assert that the court lacks jurisdiction in part because the Plaintiffs\u2019 challenges are not to final agency actions and the grant terminations are not subject to APA review.\nUpdate 3: On May 5, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, rebutting the arguments of the Defendants put forth in their May 1st Opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction motion and reiterating the arguments in favor of a Preliminary Injunction.\nUpdate 4: On May 12, the Court found that it has subject matter jurisdiction over the action. \nUpdate 5: On June 23, Judge Young issued a final judgment declaring that the administration\u2019s termination of hundreds of NIH grants was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d under the Administrative Procedure Act and ordering the affected grants reinstated. This decision follows Judge Young\u2019s earlier bench ruling, in which he reportedly described the cancellations as \u201cbereft of reasoning, virtually in their entirety\u201d and stated, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen government racial discrimination like this.\u201d\nUpdate 6: On June 24, the government filed an appeal.\nUpdate 7: On July 2, Judge Young issued a findings of fact and rulings of law setting forth his reasoning.2025-07-02\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsHarris County Texas v.

Plaintiffs, local governments and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), sued, alleging that the termination violates constitutional protections for separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s bar on actions contrary to statute or agency regulations. Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment that Defendants\u2019 actions are unlawful and injunctions mandating that Defendants reinstate eliminated grant funding and spend appropriated funds.2025-04-24\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsState of New York v. United States Department of Education (S.D.N.Y.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-02990Complaint2025-04-10Overview:  On March 28, 2025, the Department of Education (DOE) notified the education departments of States that had previously received pandemic relief funding for education purposes that existing extensions to the funding were cancelled. On April 10, 2025 a coalition of 16 States and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit challenging the rescission decision claiming that it was in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and asking the Court to set it aside as unlawful. On May 6, the Judge entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the DOE from enforcing this notification of the rescission of funds and requiring that the DOE provide at least 14 days\u2019 notice before modifying any previously approved funding.\nCase summary: During the Covid-19 pandemic, Covid appropriated funds to strengthen and support Plaintiffs\u2019 education programs under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARP) and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (CRRSA). These grants were specifically made available through Sept. 2023 (for CRRSA grants) and Sept. 2024 (for ARP grants) and had an additional 120 day period (the liquidation period) to draw down the funds after that date. States were invited to request extensions of these liquidation periods, and Plaintiffs did so at various points after May 2023 (when the federal government declared the pandemic over), including in their requests detailed information about how the funds would be spent. These extensions were granted through March 2025 for CRRSA funds and March 2026 for ARP funds. Plaintiffs allege that based on these extensions, they made significant budgetary decisions and earmarked (and in some cases, spent money for which reimbursement has not yet been requested) funds for various critical programs and infrastructure improvements for schools.  \nOn Mar. 28, Plaintiffs received a letter (the Rescission Letter) notifying them that the liquidation period for these funds was ending on that day, and stating that the prior approvals of requests to extend the liquidation periods were not justified or consistent with their priorities. Plaintiffs filed a suit on Apr. 10 claiming that the rescission decision was a violation of the APA as arbitrary and capricious and that the blanket rescission of all extension approvals was a final agency action that was contrary to law. They asked the Court to set aside the Rescission Letter and any further actions taken to implement or enforce it, declare the rescissions an unlawful violation of APA, and preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from implementing or enforcing the Rescission Letter.\nUpdate 1: On April 11 Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 25, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s preliminary injunction motion, arguing that since both the Rescission Letter and a subsequent letter on April 3 lay out a procedure for seeking project-specific extensions of the liquidation period, there is a revised procedure in place so the Rescission Letter does not represent a final agency action. They also contend that Plaintiffs have not suffered irreparable harm since they have not sought extensions under these procedures, and that the rescissions are within the discretion of the DOE.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 29 Plaintiffs filed a reply arguing that the new process does not render the prior rescission not final, and reasserting that the removal of the funds has caused them irreparable harm.\nUpdate 4: On May 6, the Judge granted the Preliminary Injunction, enjoining the Defendants from enforcing or implementing the directives in the Rescission Letter against Plaintiffs and requiring them to provide 14 days\u2019 notice going forward prior to modifying any previously approved liquidation periods.2025-05-06\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsState of New York v. Department of Education (D. Mass)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-11116Complaint2025-04-25Overview:  A coalition of nineteen states sued to block the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) from enforcing its April 3 directive ordering states to certify their compliance with civil rights laws as a requirement for receiving federal funds for education. The Plaintiffs claim that the certification requirement is an effort to weaponize Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to eliminate programs supporting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). The district court has provisionally blocked the government action, and the government has appealed.\nCase Summary: Following a series of Executive Orders (EOs) by President Trump aimed at eliminating (DEI) programs and practices in schools, the DOE Office for Civil Rights published a Dear Colleague Letter on Feb. 14, 2025 announcing its intentions for enforcing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which bans race-based affirmative action and which the administration views as restricting DEI. While State and Local Education Agencies (SEAs and LEAs) routinely provide written assurances that they will comply with Title VI as a requirement for receiving federal funds for education, on Apr. 3, the DOE informed SEAs that they would now be required to complete a new form of certification showing compliance with the principles underlying the Students for Fair Admissions decision. The new certification requires SEAs to affirmatively investigate whether LEAs are supporting DEI, report on any non-compliance, and develop plans to enforce compliance. It requires SEA\u2019s to obtain separate certifications for each LEA in their state. Continued federal financial assistance was made expressly contingent upon certification, and the SEAs were threatened with potential liability and litigation consequences for failure to certify.\nThe DOE reached an Agreement to postpone the deadline of certification to Apr.24, and on Apr. 25 nineteen states sued to block enforcement of the certification requirement. The plaintiffs allege that the certification requirement is an unjustified interference with state and local control of education and that many of the federal funding statutes under which the states receive funding specifically require the implementation of a number of practices relating to DEI. They also assert that the certification requirement is an unlawful interpretation of existing civil rights laws, and that compliance is impossible due to the impermissibly vague language of the requirement. \nThe complaint alleges that the certification requirement violates the Administrative Procedure Act as contrary to law including Title VI, DOE enabling legislation and other statutes such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, in excess of statutory and regulatory authority, without observance of procedure, and arbitrary and capricious. The Plaintiffs also assert violation of Separation of Powers due to usurping of legislative authority, the Appropriations Clause, the Spending Clause, and ultra vires doctrines.\nThe Plaintiffs ask the court to declare the certification requirement unlawful, null and void, and vacated, and to preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Defendants from implementing the certification requirement.\nUpdate 1: On Jun. 3, Judge Edgardo Ramos granted a preliminary injunction, and the Government appealed to the Second Circuit the following day.\n2025-06-04\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsAmerican Association of Physicians for human rights, et al v. National Institutes of Health (D.Md.)\n\nCase No. 8:25-cv-01620Complaint2025-05-20Overview:  As a result of the Trump administration\u2019s executive orders on diversity and gender ideology, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ceased grants and funding for the study of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) health initiatives. Plaintiffs represent many healthcare practitioners as well as a national nonprofit that work and study in the LGBTQI+ health space, all of whom allege significant harm as a result of the NIH funding cuts.\nCase Summary: Following several executive orders (EOs 14168, 14151, 14173) and directives targeting \u201cdiversity\u201d, \u201cgender ideology\u201d and \u201cwokeness\u201d, The National Institutes of Health (NIH) cancelled hundreds of research grants totalling over $800 million, which were previously dedicated to addressing the health needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) Americans. Plaintiffs represent several healthcare practitioners and a nonprofit who work in the LGBTQI+ health industry and who anticipate their work to be significantly harmed by the cancellation of NIH grants. Defendants are the NIH, the NIH Director, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the HHS Secretary. Plaintiffs allege that the  actions of the NIH and HHS constitute ten violations of law, including violations of the Separation of Powers, several violations of the APA (for being arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law, contrary to regulation, contrary to a constitutional right, and for being unreasonably delayed), and violations of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Component.  They seek declaratory, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.2025-05-20\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsRhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence v. Bondi (D. Rhode Island)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00279 Complaint2025-06-16Overview:  A group of domestic violence and sexual assault organizations filed suit against the DOJ over new conditions created to receive federal grant funding. The plaintiffs allege that these conditions impose vague requirements that violate constitutional protections, such as promising to not support \u201cgender ideology\u201d or run \u201cDEI programs\u201d to receive grants. Plaintiffs allege that these changes would disrupt life-saving services and harm survivors nationwide.\nCase Summary: Plaintiffs are a coalition of domestic violence and sexual assault groups that have received federal grant funding from the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), which supports services for victims and survivors, including emergency shelters, legal assistance, counseling, and community education. Many of these non-profit organizations and coalitions have received OVW funding for decades. In June 2025, OVW issued a set of new certification requirements for grantees, which prohibits the use of federal funding to \u201cpromote gender ideology,\u201d operate \u201cDEI programs,\u201d or \"prioritize illegal aliens[.]\u201d Plaintiffs allege that new OVW requirements are overbroad, go against the core values of the Violence Against Women Act, and terminate funding that keeps life-saving programs running. Alternatively, Plaintiffs allege that agreeing to new OVW requirements will expose them to liability under the False Claims Act, which carries financial penalties and allows private parties to sue for alleged misuse of federal funds. On June 16, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the District of Rhode Island. Plaintiffs allege that new OVW requirements violate the Spending Clause and the Separation of Powers Clause for imposing unauthorized and coercive grant restrictions; infringe on First Amendment rights for compelling and chilling speech; and violate the Due Process Clause for crafting vague and ambiguous conditions. Plaintiffs also allege that the new requirements exceed the Executive\u2019s power, and the conditions violate the Administrative Procedure Act for being arbitrary and capricious, contrary to law and constitutional right, and exceeding Defendants\u2019 statutory authority. Plaintiffs seek to declare the new requirements as unlawful and to enjoin the DOJ and OVW from enforcing the new certification conditions as part of the OVW grant process. 2025-06-16\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsVERA Institute of Justice v. U.S. Department of Justice (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No: 1:25-cv-01643\nComplaint2025-05-21Overview:  A coalition of nonprofit organizations filed a class action lawsuit against the DOJ, challenging the abrupt termination of over 370 multi-year cooperative agreements and grants totaling more than $820 million. The plaintiffs allege that the DOJ's Office of Justice Programs ended these grants without prior notice, justification, or authority to do so, causing immediate and irreparable harm to the organizations and the communities they serve.\nCase Summary: Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations that have been receiving federal grants from the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Justice Programs (OJP) for a variety of services at the community level, including training law enforcement, developing initiatives to prevent crime and address its drivers, assisting crime victims, and working to interrupt gun crime.  Many of these organisations had been receiving grant funding for numerous years.\nIn April 2025, OJP informed Plaintiffs and other grantees that they were terminating their agreements and grants as the \u201cawards no longer effectuate[] the program goals or agency priorities.\u201d OJP ordered the grantees to stop work immediately and informed them that they would be reimbursed only up to the date of the termination letter. Plaintiffs state that they received no advance notice of the terminations and have substantial unreimbursed expenses incurred prior to termination. They allege that the terminations have caused immediate and irreparable harm to both their organisations and to the recipients of their services. \nThe plaintiffs filed a class action lawsuit on May 21, seeking to  represent a class of all entities whose OJP grants were terminated in April 2025.They argue that the termination violates the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause due to vagueness and the failure to provide reasonable notice and due process, as well as the Separation of Powers, Spending and Appropriations Clauses, and the Take Care Clause as an unlawful exercise of the exclusive right of Congress to appropriate federal money. They also argue that the terminations violate the Administrative Procedure Act as arbitrary and capricious, contrary to a constitutional right, and contrary to law on the basis that OJP did not \u201cclearly and unambiguously\u201d state in Plaintiffs\u2019 award documents that it could terminate an award because an award no longer effectuates program goals or agency priorities. \nPlaintiffs seek to declare the terminations unlawful and unconstitutional and preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants and their agents from enforcing or implementing the terminations.\nUpdate 1: On July 7, Judge Mehta dismissed a challenge to the administration\u2019s grant termination from the Office of Justice Programs. While calling the administration\u2019s actions \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201clikely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence,\u201d the court concluded it lacked the power to hear claims under the Administrative Procedure Act\u2014finding these should instead be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims\u2014and that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate any constitutional violation.2025-07-07\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsShapiro v. Department of Agriculture (M.D.Pa) \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00998 Complaint2025-06-04Overview:  Pennsylvania officials sued the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Secretary of USDA, and the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) over USDA\u2019s cancellation of grant funding to the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) to support the Local Food Purchase Assistance Program (LFPA). LFPA funds are used to purchase food from local producers to be distributed to underserved communities in need of food assistance. USDA informed the PDA that it was cancelling LFPA funding because it no longer effectuates agency priorities under 2 C.F.R 200.340(a)(4). Plaintiffs allege this cancellation violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Fifth Amendment.\nCase Summary: On March 7, 2025, the Deputy Administrator of AMS sent a letter to PDA notifying the state agency that the existing contract for the LFPA funding would be terminated in 60 days because the program no longer effectuates agency priorities. Plaintiffs are Josh Shapiro, Governor of Pennsylvania, Russell Redding, Secretary of the PDA, and the PDA. Plaintiffs allege that cancelling this contract will have a negative impact on Pennsylvania food banks, will deprive low-income Pennsylvanians of food and nutrition, and remove an important market for 190 Pennsylvania farmers who sell to the PDA. Plaintiffs allege that the termination violates the APA, arguing that the decision is arbitrary and capricious, constitutes unlawful agency action, violates controlling regulations regarding grant termination, and deprives Plaintiffs of due process required under the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Plaintiffs have requested the court vacate the termination.2025-06-04\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsUrban Sustainability Directors Network v. Department of Agriculture (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01775Complaint2025-06-05Overview:  Nonprofit organizations sued the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Secretary of USDA, and the heads of various sub-agencies over USDA\u2019s cancellation of grant funding to a variety of grant-making programs, including: the U.S. Forest Service\u2019s  (USFS) Urban and Community Forest Assistance (UCFA) program, the the National Resources Conservation Service\u2019s (NRCS) Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities (PCSC) program, and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture\u2019s (NIFA) Community Food Projects Competitive Grants Program (CFPCGP). The complaint alleges that these grant programs enabled plaintiffs to hire staff, expand programs, enter into contracts with local businesses, and engage in other actions related to their organizations\u2019 mandates. USDA informed the nonprofit organizations that it was cancelling the grant funding because it no longer effectuates agency priorities under 2 C.F.R. 200.340(a)(4) and as outlined in Executive Orders issued by President Donald Trump. Plaintiffs allege this cancellation violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Fifth Amendment, and the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers. \nCase Summary: Throughout the initial weeks of his administration, President Donald Trump issued a series of Executive Orders \u2013 EOs 14151, 14173, and 14154 \u2013 seeking to end federal support for initiatives related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and to climate change mitigation.  Defendants terminated plaintiffs\u2019 previously awarded grant funds, notifying plaintiffs that the grants were \u201cinconsistent with, and no longer effectuate\u201d the Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) priorities under 2 C.F.R 200.340(a)(4), as determined by Trump\u2019s recently issued EOs. Plaintiffs claim that these sudden terminations occurred without the notice and individualized consideration required by law, and that they harm the plaintiff organizations, the plaintiff organizations\u2019 clients, and the plaintiff organizations\u2019 communities by forcing plaintiffs to layoff employees, to discontinue services, and, in some cases, to shut down completely. Plaintiffs specifically allege that the grant terminations 1) deprive plaintiffs of the notice and due process mandated by the Fifth Amendment, 2) are contrary to the statutory law and regulations governing the grants (Uniform Guidance, 2 C.F.R. \u00a7 400.1; Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978; Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) and thereby violate \u00a7 706(2)(A) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 3) are arbitrary and capricious under \u00a7 706(2)(A) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 4) violate the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers (U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 1) by withholding funds previously appropriated by Congress, and 5) constitute an ultra vires action that exceeds the USDA\u2019s authority. Plaintiffs request that the court vacate the grant terminations through temporary restraining orders and permanent injunctions.2025-06-11\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsCity Of Chicago v. United States Department of Homeland Security (N.D.

The complaint alleges that while FEMA sent the Plaintiffs similar letters with deadlines to respond to an investigation into unlawful use of the funds to shelter undocumented people, FEMA preemptively terminated the program in its entirety before the deadlines. As the program had been made and funded by Congress, the Plaintiffs claim that such actions violate the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and the Constitution. \nCase Summary: On Feb. 10, 2025, FEMA abruptly paused all federal grants previously disbursed or made available under the Shelter and Services Program (SSP), cancelling them completely a few weeks later. The actions followed a tweet on Feb. 10 by Elon Musk claiming that the program was unlawfully assisting undocumented people in New York. The complaint alleges that while FEMA sent the Plaintiffs similar letters with deadlines to respond to an investigation into unlawful use of the funds to shelter undocumented people, FEMA preemptively terminated the program in its entirety before the deadlines. Plaintiffs allege that the termination violates the Separation of Powers and the Spending Clause as the Shelter and Services Program was enacted and funded by Congress, and any rescinding or deference of funding by the Executive requires the approval of Congress which was not sought. Further, plaintiffs allege that the Defendants acted in ultra vires, beyond their legal authority, by terminating the Shelter and Services program, and that Defendants actions constitute several substantive and procedural violations of the APA, including being arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. The Plaintiffs requested that the Court vacate FEMA\u2019s termination of the Shelter and Services Program, restore funding, and issue a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring the Defendants to undo the removal of funds and eliminate impediments to the Plaintiffs\u2019 ability to submit future drawdown requests under the Shelter and Services Program and to process future requests.\nUpdate 1: On Jul.12 Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 2: Judge Matthew Kennelly granted a TRO on July 12, but then vacated it on July 15 following a hearing.2025-07-15\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsCity Of Chicago v.

In 2025, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) implemented new requirements for certain organizations seeking to receive funding through this program. In particular, the requirement articulated that these organizations must demonstrate \u201calignment with current Presidential Executive Orders\u201d and identified several Executive Orders that may be of most relevance to the work of the TPP Program (including EOs 14168, 14190, 14187, 14151, and 14173). Plaintiffs, Planned Parenthood organizations across the country that have historically received funding from the TPP Program, allege that Defendants have violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s (APA) \u201ccontrary to law\u201d and  \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standards. They also bring an ultra vires action, alleging that HHS exceeded its authority by imposing additional obligations on TPP grantees not contemplated by the statutory framework established by Congress for the TPP Program. Plaintiffs seek a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent HHS from implementing, maintaining, or giving effect to the new HHS requirements. \nUpdate 1: On May 12, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the implementation of HHS\u2019s new requirements on certain TPP recipients. \nUpdate 2: On May 28, 2025, Defendants filed a memorandum in opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025-05-28\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsAmerican Federation of Teachers v. Department of Education (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00802Complaint2025-03-18Overview:  The American Federation of Teachers brought suit against the Department of Education (DOE) alleging that its decision to shut down access to income-driven repayment plans for student loans violates the\nAdministrative Procedure Act as both the unlawful withholding of agency action and as arbitrary and capricious.\nCase Summary: Pursuant to a Congressional mandate, the Department of Education (DOE) has for many years offered a variety of loan repayment options relating to student loans, including income-driven repayment plans (IDR) tying the borrower\u2019s monthly payment to their income, and plans where public service can earn credit to discharge loans (Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)).On February 26, 2025 the Administration issued a Stop Work Order directing all loan servicers to stop accepting and processing IDR applications, including plans that are PSLF eligible. The American Federation of Teachers (AFT), a membership organization representing 1.8 million teachers, educators, paraprofessionals, federal, state, and local government employees and nurses and other healthcare and education professionals, filed suit on March 18, 2025, seeking to compel the DOE to provide borrowers with the ability to re-pay their loans through income-driven repayment plans.The Plaintiff argues that  the actions of the DOE violate the Administrative Procedure Act as both the unlawful withholding of agency action and as arbitrary and capricious and seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, preventing the Department from collecting from borrowers who are eligible for income-driven repayments.\nUpdate 1: On March 24, 2025, the Plaintiff filed a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order, seeking to enjoin the Defendants from their continued denial of income-driven repayment plans for student loan borrowers. \nUpdate 2: On April 8, 2025, the Defendantsfiled a memorandum in opposition to the Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a Temporary Restraining Order. \nUpdate 3: On April 14, 2025, the Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a Temporary Restraining Order was denied without prejudice. \nUpdate 4: On April 17, 2025, the court ordered that both parties shall submit a joint status report regarding how they wish to proceed in this case. \nUpdate 5: On April 25, 2025, the Plaintiff provided a joint status report. \nUpdate 6: On May 15, 2025, the Defendants provided a status report. 2025-05-15\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Denial of federal grantsAmerican Association of Physics Teachers v.

Plaintiffs, consisting of organizations representing professors, researchers, and graduate students,  filed suit, alleging that Defendants violated the Constitution and Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. \nCase Summary: Part of the National Science Foundation\u2019s (NSF) congressional mandate is to expand the participation of underrepresented persons in STEM fields. In line with this mandate, the NSF has long been a major source of federal funding for projects to broaden participation of underrepresented populations in the STEM field. On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14151, titled \u201cEnding Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.\u201d Pursuant to this EO, the NSF updated its priorities for funding research and terminated over $1 billion of previously awarded scientific grants, cooperative agreements, and other financial awards. Plaintiffs are organizations of educators, professors, researchers, graduate students, and organizations whose NSF awards have recently been terminated by NSF.

The Department of Education terminated these grants on April 29, 2025, declaring that the funding of mental health grants did not reflect the priorities of the Trump administration. Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants (Linda McMahon, in her capacity as Secretary of Education, and the US Department of Education) violated the First Amendment by restricting speech between mental health professionals and School District staff, the Fifth Amendment due process clause, the spending clause,and the APA\u2019s \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard.

The governments argue that the policy violates federal law and exceeds NIH\u2019s authority. The governments have requested the court declare the policy unlawful and immediately and permanently block implementation of the policy. The court granted their request and has blocked the policy from implementation nationwide, and required reporting by NIH to ensure compliance. NIH has appealed the court\u2019s decision to a higher court. \nCase Summary: The National Institutes of Health\u2019s guidance imposes an across-the-board 15 percent reimbursement rate for \u201cindirect costs\u201d of medical research, which research institutions have historically negotiated on an individual basis. Plaintiffs, 22 state governments whose public research institutions will face hardship under the policy, allege that the policy violates the Administrative Procedure Act \u2013 including as an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d change that failed to weigh reliance interests and that involves a reversal of fact-finding and as an action in excess the NIH\u2019s statutory authority and in violation of Congress\u2019s express directives in appropriating NIH funding. They seek declaratory judgment and a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctions against implementing the policy in the plaintiff states.\nOn Feb. 10, 2025, Judge Angel Kelley granted the plaintiffs emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and imposed a regular reporting requirement on the part of the administration to confirm compliance.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 5, 2025: Judge Kelley issued a nationwide preliminary injunction prohibiting implementation of the NIH Guidance \u201cin any form with respect to institutions nationwide.\u201d\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 4, 2025, Judge Kelley granted NIH\u2019s motion to convert the Mar. 5 order on a preliminary injunction to an order on a permanent injunction and final judgement, so as to facilitate prompt appellate review of the nationwide block on implementation of the NIH Guidance. \nUpdate 3: On Apr. 8, 2025, NIH appealed the final judgment and permanent injunction issued by Judge Kelley on Apr. 4 to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.2025-04-08\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Reduction of indirect cost reimbursement rate for research institutions (NIH Guidance) (DOE Rate Cap Policy, Apr. 11, 2025) (DOE Guidance, April 11, 2025) (DOD Memorandum May 14, 2025)Association of American Universities, et al. v.

The institutions argue that the policy violates the constitution and federal law, and exceeds NIH's authority. The institutions have asked the courts to declare the policy unlawful and to stop implementation of the policy. The court has their request and has blocked the policy from implementation nationwide.\nCase Summary: National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidance imposes an across-the-board 15 percent reimbursement rate for \u201cindirect costs\u201d of medical research, which research institutions have historically negotiated on an individual basis. Plaintiffs, including associations representing universities and college and individual universities, allege the reduction in indirect cost rate to 15% will have immediate destructive effects on NIH-funded research. They sued, arguing the policy is unlawful under of the Administrative Procedure Act in that it (1) is contrary to law in that it departs from the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2024; (2) is contrary to law as it violates the Constitution\u2019s Appropriation Clause; (3) is contrary to law as it departs from negotiated cost rates provided by 45 C.F.R. 75.414 and NIH Grants Policy Statement; (4) is an arbitrary and capricious abuse of discretion; (5) is contrary to law as it departs from HHS cost recovery regulations and policy guidance; (6) fails to observe required notice-and-comment procedures; (7) is contrary to law violates the Public Health Service Act; and (8) is in excess of statutory authority as a retroactive action. Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the policy is unlawful and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. Later on Feb. 10, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order to prohibit Defendants from implementing the policy.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 5, 2025: Judge Kelley issued a nationwide preliminary injunction prohibiting implementation of the NIH Guidance \u201cin any form with respect to institutions nationwide.\u201d\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 4, Defendants filed an assented-to motion for a permanent injunction, seeking to convert the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction and enter final judgment in order to facilitate the appeals process.\nOn that same day, Judge Kelley granted the motion and entered a final judgment and permanent injunction in favor of the Plaintiffs.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 8, Defendants appealed the final judgment and permanent injunction to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.2025-04-04\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Reduction of indirect cost reimbursement rate for research institutions (NIH Guidance) (DOE Rate Cap Policy, Apr. 11, 2025) (DOE Guidance, April 11, 2025) (DOD Memorandum May 14, 2025)Association of American Medical Colleges v.

The organizations argue that the policy violates federal law, and exceeds NIH's authority. The organizations have asked the courts to stop implementation of the policy; the court has granted their request and has blocked the policy from implementation nationwide. DHHS and NIH have appealed this decision to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.\nCase Summary: The National Institutes of Health\u2019s guidance imposes an across-the-board 15 percent reimbursement rate for \u201cindirect costs\u201d of medical research, which research institutions have historically negotiated on an individual basis. Plaintiffs, including associations representing universities, hospitals, and health systems across the country, allege that the Rate Change Notice is invalid under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) and seek to enjoin any actions taken to implement its directives. They argue that the Rate Change Notice is contrary to Health and Human Services\u2019s (HHS) existing regulations and the 2024 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act. Moreover, they contend that it is arbitrary and capricious and failed to undergo required notice and comment rulemaking. \nOn Feb. 10, 2025, Judge Angel Kelley issued a nationwide temporary restraining order against the NIH policy.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 5, 2025, Judge Kelley issued a nationwide preliminary injunction prohibiting implementation of the NIH Guidance \u201cin any form with respect to institutions nationwide.\u201d\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 4, 2025, Judge Kelley granted NIH\u2019s motion to convert the Mar. 5 order on a preliminary injunction to an order on a permanent injunction and final judgement, so as to facilitate prompt appellate review of the nationwide block on implementation of the NIH Guidance. \nUpdate 3: On Apr. 8, 2025, NIH appealed the final judgment and permanent injunction issued by Judge Kelley on Apr. 4 to the First Circuit Court of Appeals.2025-04-08\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Reduction of indirect cost reimbursement rate for research institutions (NIH Guidance) (DOE Rate Cap Policy, Apr. 11, 2025) (DOE Guidance, April 11, 2025) (DOD Memorandum May 14, 2025)Association of American Universities v. Department of Energy (D. Mass.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-10912Complaint2025-04-14Overview:  Several academic institutions and university associations sued the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Secretary of the DOE challenging a new DOE policy that caps the amount of reimbursements available for federal research grants. The institutions argue that the policy violates federal law and exceeds DOE\u2019s authority. The institutions have asked the courts to declare the policy unlawful and to stop implementation of the policy. The court has blocked the policy from implementation nationwide.\nCase Summary: The Department of Energy (DOE) on Apr. 11, 2025 issued a new \u201cRate Cap Policy\u201d, which imposes an across-the-board 15 percent reimbursement rate for \u201cindirect costs\u201d of research, which academic institutions have historically negotiated on an individual basis. The DOE also announced that it will terminate all university grant awards that do not conform with the new policy. Plaintiffs, including associations representing universities and colleges and individual universities, sued on Apr. 14, alleging that the reduction in indirect cost rate to 15% will have immediate destructive effects on DOE-funded research. The academic institutions argue that the Rate Cap Policy violates the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s indirect cost regulations and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The academic institutions also argue that the DOE\u2019s Cap Rate Policy is substantially similar to the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\u2019s policy capping indirect costs, the implementation of which courts have blocked nationwide. The academic institutions ask that the court vacate the Rate Cap Policy and declare it unlawful. They also seek a preliminary and permanent block on the DOE\u2019s implementation of the Rate Cap Policy or modification of negotiated indirect cost rates and termination of any grants pursuant to the Policy.\nUpdate 1: After filing their complaint on Apr. 14, Plaintiffs immediately filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO). Plaintiffs request that the court block Defendants from implementing, instituting, maintaining, or giving effect to the Rate Cap Policy in any form; from terminating grants pursuant to the Rate Cap Policy; and from otherwise modifying negotiated indirect cost rates (except as permitted by statute and regulations). The next day, Plaintiffs notified the court of Defendants\u2019 actions to proceed with the implementation of the Rate Cap Policy and urged the court to grant the TRO.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 16, Judge Allison Burroughs granted the TRO against Defendants.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 22, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a TRO in which they claim that the court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 claims following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Dep\u2019t of Education v. California.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 25, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for a TRO in which it emphasized the arbitrary and unlawful nature of the Rate Cap Policy.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 29, Judge Burroughs extended the TRO until further order is issued resolving the request for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 6: On May 15, Judge Burroughs granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the DOE\u2019s Rate Cap Policy likely violates the APA\u2014by taking agency action that conflicts with existing regulation, is arbitrary and capricious, and is impermissibly retroactive\u2014and poses a risk of irreparable harm to research institutions.2025-05-15\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Reduction of indirect cost reimbursement rate for research institutions (NIH Guidance) (DOE Rate Cap Policy, Apr. 11, 2025) (DOE Guidance, April 11, 2025) (DOD Memorandum May 14, 2025)Association of American Universities v.

The Plaintiffs argue that the policy exceeds NSF\u2019s authority and violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and have asked the courts to declare the policy unlawful and to stop implementation of the policy.\nCase Summary: On May 2, the NSF issued a new policy imposing an across-the-board 15 percent reimbursement rate for \u201cindirect costs\u201d of all new grant and cooperative agreement awards to universities, which research institutions have historically negotiated on an individual basis. Plaintiffs, including associations representing universities\nand college and individual universities, allege the reduction in indirect cost rate to 15% (the \u201cRate Cap Policy\u201d will have immediate destructive effects on NSF-funded research. The plaintiffs sued on May 5, arguing the policy is unlawful under the APA in that it is in violation of authorizing statutes, including federal laws governing negotiated cost rates and cost recovery regulations, and is an arbitrary and capricious abuse of discretion.

Mass.) \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11740Complaint2025-06-16Overview:  A large coalition of American research universities and educational groups are challenging the Department of Defense\u2019s new cap on federal funding of indirect research costs. On June 17, Judge Brian Murphy issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Department of Defense from enforcing its new Rate Cap Policy, which limits how much federal research funding universities and nonprofit institutions can use for indirect costs (also known as overhead) to 15%. \nCase Summary: On May 14, 2025, Secretary of the Department of Defense (\u201cDOD\u201d) Pete Hegseth issued a memorandum implementing a 15% cost cap on indirect cost assistance awards to higher education institutions. As authorized by Congress, the DOD has funded indirect costs, also known as overhead costs, for scientific research at American higher education institutions for decades. Historically, federal research funding to such institutions has been negotiated in a bespoke manner, with funding often covering between 50-65% of indirect costs. However, the new DOD policy implements a much lower universal rate of 15% funding. Plaintiffs are a group of leading research universities, education councils and university leaders which conduct robust scientific and technological research in reliance on federal funding. They allege that the rate cut would have devastating impacts on their ability to continue critical research. They allege that the DOD\u2019s Rate Cap Policy is contrary to law, in excess of statutory authority, and arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and seek a vacatur of the memorandum instituting the Rate Cap and declaratory and injunctive relief. \nUpdate 1: On June 17th, the Court granted the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order, prohibiting the DOD from enforcing the Rate Cap Policy. 2025-06-17\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Actions Toward Universities (Executive Order 14188, Pause or termination of Grants, Columbia Letter of demands, Harvard Letter of demands, Harvard Proclamation on student visas)American Association of University Professors v. United States Department of Justice (S.D.N.Y.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-02429Complaint2025-03-25Overview: The American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers, two unions representing teachers and professors, have sued the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Education and other federal agencies asking the court to temporarily and/or permanently block the Trump Administration\u2019s termination of federal funding to Columbia University and imposition of certain demands on the university on the basis that these actions violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Constitution. On June 16, the case was dismissed by the district court. That day, the Plaintiffs appealed to the Second Circuit.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 29, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled \u201cAdditional Measures to Combat Anti-Semitism.\u201d On Feb. 3, a task force was formed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to carry out the mandate of the EO, and on that same day, the Department of Education (DOE) announced a Title VI investigation into Columbia University, which was followed by a review and termination of the university\u2019s federal contracts and grants for approximately $400M as well as a Mar. 13 letter to the university demanding certain structural changes.\nPlaintiffs, the American Association of University Professors and the American Federation of Teachers, brought a suit against the DOJ, DOE, and multiple other federal agencies and their respective officers arguing that the Trump Administration\u2019s actions violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Administrative Procedure Act; the First Amendment, the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, the Tenth Amendment anti-commandeering doctrine, and the Spending Clause of the Constitution, as well as separation of powers and ultra vires doctrines. \nPlaintiffs ask the court to declare unlawful the termination of funding to Columbia University and the demands made in the Mar. 13 letter. Plaintiffs also request a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring the Defendants to reinstate all federal grants and contracts and not withhold such funds in the future, and enjoining Defendants from enforcing the demands in the March 13 letter. Plaintiffs are also requesting compensatory and nominal damages.  \nUpdate 1: On Apr. 3, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.  \nUpdate 2: On May 1, the Defendants filed a memorandum in opposition to the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, claiming that the Plaintiffs lack subject matter jurisdiction and standing and their claims also fail on the merits.\nUpdate 3: On May 8, the Plaintiffs filed a reply memorandum in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that they have standing, that the Court has jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs\u2019 statutory and constitutional claims, that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits and will suffer irreparable harm without relief, and that the balance of equities and public interest support granting preliminary injunctive relief.\nUpdate 4: On June 16, Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil dismissed the case.

Department of Justice (D. Mass.) \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-10910Complaint2025-04-11Overview:  Plaintiffs, nonprofit membership organizations of university faculty, sue multiple federal agencies that make up the DOJ\u2019s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism. The Plaintiffs argue that the Task Force\u2019s threat to withdraw all federal funding and its imposition of a set of demands to retain funding violate the Administrative Procedure Act because the Defendants acted contrary to law, contrary to procedure, and arbitrarily and capriciously. The Plaintiffs also argue that the Defendants violated the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, and acted ultra vires by interfering with Congress\u2019s spending power.\n\nCase Summary: On March 31, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, and the General Services Administration announced they were undertaking a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of approximately $9 billion of federal contracts and grants with Harvard University to ensure compliance with civil rights laws. The review is part of the DOJ\u2019s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism\u2019s efforts to give effect to Executive Order 14188. On April 3, the Task Force sent Harvard a letter outlining immediate steps Harvard needed to take to maintain federal funding. The Plaintiffs, nonprofit membership organizations of faculty, are suing the agencies comprising the Task Force to challenge the March 31 announcement of the funding review, as well as the April 3 list of demands. The Plaintiffs allege that their members are harmed by the threats to withdraw funding because much of faculty research is funded by federal grants. They also argue that members are harmed because the Defendants\u2019 actions have chilled speech and infringed upon academic freedom. \nThe Plaintiffs allege multiple legal violations. They argue that the Defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by acting contrary to procedure, contrary to the law, and arbitrarily and capriciously. The Plaintiffs argue that the Defendants violate the First Amendment in multiple ways, including by targeting specific areas of scholarship on the basis of content and viewpoint and by coercing Harvard to suppress disfavored speech. The Plaintiffs claim the Defendants acted ultra vires by usurping Congress\u2019s spending power and making an unconstitutional effort to amend Congressional appropriations. Finally, the Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause by failing to provide fair notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard.\nThe Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the review of funding, along with the March 31 threat to terminate funding and the April 3 set of demands, is unlawful. They also seek preliminary and permanent injunctions preventing further review of Harvard\u2019s federal funding in the absence of legal authority, preventing the Defendants from using the threat of withdrawing funds to coerce Harvard to suppress viewpoints or speech, and preventing the Defendants from using government power to target Harvard for the viewpoints and speech of the Plaintiffs and their members.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 11, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, asking the court to enjoin any further review and/or termination of Harvard\u2019s federal funding by the administration.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 15, Plaintiffs requested to withdraw their motion for a temporary restraining order and filed a notice of supplemental materials based on the Trump administration\u2019s Apr. 14th freeze of $2.2 billion in federal grants to Harvard, an action which allegedly caused a material change in circumstances since the original TRO filing. This request was promptly approved by the Court. \nUpdate 3: On May 5, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which included recent actions by the Trump administration and litigation by Harvard University (see President and Fellows of Harvard College v. US Department of Health and Human Services) and reiterated the requests for declaratory and injunctive relief.\nUpdate 4: On May 6, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which described actions relevant to their claims taken by the Defendants on May 5th. Leave to file was granted on May 20, at which time the second amended complaint was filed.\nUpdate 5: On Jun. 2, Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and a memorandum in support of said motion.2025-06-02\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Actions Toward Universities (Executive Order 14188, Pause or termination of Grants, Columbia Letter of demands, Harvard Letter of demands, Harvard Proclamation on student visas)President and Fellows of Harvard College v. US Department of Health and Human Services  (D.C.D. Massachusetts) \n\nCase No: 1:25-cv-11048Complaint2025-04-21Overview:  Harvard University sued multiple federal agencies after receiving two letters with a number of preconditions that Harvard must agree to in order to maintain federal funding and after the agencies froze billions of dollars in funds to Harvard following the university\u2019s refusal to comply with the government\u2019s demands. The review of Harvard\u2019s federal funding and subsequent freeze stems from the federal government\u2019s allegations that Harvard violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by failing to adequately address anti-semitism on campus. Harvard alleges that the government has acted ultra vires and in violation of the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 31, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Education, and the General Services Administration announced a review of approximately $9 billion in federal contracts and grants issued to Harvard University to ensure compliance with civil rights laws. The review is part of the efforts of the DOJ\u2019s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism to give effect to Executive Order 14188. On Apr. 3 and Apr. 11, the government sent Harvard letters outlining steps that it must take to maintain federal funding. Harvard refused to comply and on Apr. 14, the government froze approximately $2.8 billion in funding to Harvard (the \u201cFreeze Order\u201d). Harvard filed suit challenging both the conditions set out in the letters and the Freeze Order. \nHarvard alleges that the government\u2019s actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act in multiple ways. It argues the government has acted contrary to constitutional rights because its demands regarding hiring decisions, admissions practices, and student group recognition, among others, violate Harvard's First Amendment rights. The Freeze Order is also alleged to be in violation of the First Amendment because it was issued in retaliation for Harvard\u2019s engagement in protected speech. Harvard argues that the government acted in excess of statutory authority, not in accordance with the law, and without observing procedures required by law because the government failed to follow mandatory procedures for terminating federal funding in connection with Title VI violations. Harvard additionally claims that the government\u2019s actions were arbitrary and capricious. Finally, Harvard makes a standalone First Amendment claim and argues that the government\u2019s actions are ultra vires. \nHarvard seeks an order declaring unlawful and setting aside the Freeze Order and the conditions in the April letters. Harvard also seeks permanent injunctions prohibiting the government from violating the university\u2019s First Amendment rights and from terminating federal funding without complying with the applicable laws.\nUpdate 1: On May 13, the Plaintiff submitted an amended complaint adding to its filings. The amended complaint includes: additional Defendants, the US Department of Agriculture, the Secretary of Agriculture, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and additional factual allegations relating to letters received in May from the National Institutes of Health, the US Department of Agriculture, the US Department of Energy, the National Science Foundation, and the US Department of Education.\nUpdate 2: On June 2, President and Fellows of Harvard College filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the Court should grant summary judgment to Harvard, vacate and set aside the Government\u2019s unlawful freeze and termination of Harvard\u2019s funding, and permanently enjoin any similar action such as the termination of other contracts.2025-06-02\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Actions Toward Universities (Executive Order 14188, Pause or termination of Grants, Columbia Letter of demands, Harvard Letter of demands, Harvard Proclamation on student visas)President and Fellows of Harvard College v. Department of Homeland Security (D. Mass.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-11472Complaint2025-05-23Overview:  Harvard University sued the Department of Homeland Security challenging the revocation of Harvard\u2019s Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), which would have the effect of blocking current and future international students from attending Harvard. Harvard alleges that the revocation was the culmination of a retaliatory campaign by the Trump administration on academic freedom at Harvard. They argue that the revocation constitutes an infringement of the university\u2019s Due Process and First Amendment rights, in particular Harvard\u2019s constitutional right to be free of retaliatory action for protected speech, as well as violating the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Harvard asks the Court to declare the revocation unlawful and unconstitutional and stop the government from implementing or enforcing the revocation. Harvard subsequently requested a Temporary Restraining Order, which the federal court granted within hours, and the judge later said she would grant a preliminary injunction. \nCase Summary: Along with other US colleges and universities, Harvard hosts international students with F-1 visas, which permits international students to be present in the United States, under a program called the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). The SEVP program is overseen by the DHS. On April 16, 2025, Kristi Noem, the Secretary of DHS, sent Harvard University\u2019s International Office (HIO) a letter (the \u201cRecords Request\u201d) criticizing Harvard for alleged failures in condemning antisemitism and demanding that HIO produce a wide range of information for each student visa holder across Harvard\u2019s 13 schools within ten business days. Failure to do so would be treated as a voluntary withdrawal from the F-1 visa program. Among other things, the information requested included all records of the participation of international students in protests on Harvard\u2019s campus.\n\nHarvard produced information in response to this demand on April 30 and again on May 14, after a follow up request. On May 22, Secretary Noem sent Harvard a letter (the \u201cRevocation Notice\u201d) which stated that DHS deemed Harvard\u2019s responses insufficient and that Harvard\u2019s SEVP certification was revoked, effective immediately. The Revocation Notice stated that all Harvard international students on non-immigrant visas must transfer to another university to maintain their non-immigrant status, and that Harvard is prohibited from having any international students for the 2025-2026 academic school year.\n\nHarvard filed suit the following morning, on May 23, claiming that the Revocation Notice is the culmination of a retaliatory attack on academic freedom at Harvard which they allege had been developing over the last few months. They emphasize in particular an April 11 letter to Harvard from a multi-agency Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism (Federal Task Force) conditioned Harvard\u2019s continued receipt of numerous federal funding benefits on accepting changes to Harvard\u2019s governance, admissions, hiring and academic programs, as well as numerous public statements by the administration about Harvard. \n\nHarvard alleges that the Revocation Notice is a violation of its First Amendment right to be free of retaliatory action for engaging in protected speech, pointing out that the April 11 demand letter goes to the core of Harvard\u2019s constitutionally protected academic freedom by asserting governmental control over Harvard\u2019s teaching community and governance. The suit contends that the Revocation Notice constitutes First Amendment viewpoint discrimination and violates the APA because it conditions government benefits on relinquishing constitutional rights, as well as violating Due Process rights by failing to follow codified procedural protections. It claims the government\u2019s actions are ultra vires and arbitrary and capricious.\n\nThe complaint asks for a declaration that the actions to revoke SEVP certification through Revocation Notice are unconstitutional and unlawful because they violate the First Amendment, Due Process Clause, and APA, and to preliminarily and permanently enjoin them from implementing, or otherwise initiating proceedings to withdraw Harvard from the program due to its First Amendment exercise  or refusal to comply with April 11 demand letter. On the same day, Harvard also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and accompanying memorandum, citing immediate and irreparable harm.\n\nOn May 23, Judge Allison Burroughs granted a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 1: On May 29, Judge Burroughs ruling from the bench reportedly said the court would issue a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 2: On Jun. 4, the president issued a new Proclamation titled \u201cEnhancing National Security by Addressing Risks at Harvard University\u201d that suspends entry of foreign nationals who plan to attend Harvard University. On Jun. 5, the Plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order with a memorandum. \nUpdate 3: On June 5, Judge Burroughs temporarily blocked the administration\u2019s effort to prevent foreign students from enrolling at Harvard, halting the policy while legal challenges continue. \nThe court found that the administration\u2019s proclamation would cause \u201cimmediate and irreparable injury\u201d to Harvard and its international students.\nUpdate 4: Judge Burroughs issued a preliminary injunction on June 20 barring that administration from banning Harvard from participating in the State Department\u2019s Student and Visitor Exchange Program.\nUpdate 5: Judge Burroughs issued an order on June 23 halting the administration\u2019s proclamation to suspend entry for any international students studying at Harvard. \nJudge Burroughs had issued a preliminary injunction on June 20 to similar effect, but provided reasoning for her injunction this time. In the order, she wrote, \u201cthe government\u2019s misplaced efforts to control a reputable academic institution and squelch diverse viewpoints seemingly because they are, in some instances, opposed to this Administration\u2019s own views,\u201d threatened core constitutional rights, which she notes \u201cmust be safeguarded.\u201d2025-06-23\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Actions Toward Universities (Executive Order 14188, Pause or termination of Grants, Columbia Letter of demands, Harvard Letter of demands, Harvard Proclamation on student visas)Thakur v.

The plaintiffs allege funding cuts were made without notice, explanation or legal authority and seek an injunction to restore lost funding, block further unlawful grant terminations and provide extensions necessary to complete work for which grants were originally approved.\nCase Summary: Faculty members and researchers from the University of California filed a class action lawsuit challenging the termination of federal research grants across multiple agencies, including the Department of Defense (DOD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and National Science Foundation (NSF). These cuts were implemented through the Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE). The plaintiffs allege that the funding cancellations cut off funds awarded by Congress without notice, explanation, or legal authority to do so and seek for themselves (and the class of University of California faculty, staff, academic appointees, and employees) an injunction to restore lost funding, enjoin further unlawful grant terminations or suspensions, and provide grant extensions necessary to complete the work for which grants were originally approved. \nUpdate 1: On June 5, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order with a memorandum in support.\nUpdate 2: On June 23, Judge Rita Lin granted a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On July 11, the administration filed a motion for a stay of preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit, seeking to reverse Judge Lin\u2019s order blocking the administration\u2019s mass termination of University of California research grants tied to DEI-related topics. 2025-07-11\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Unleashing American Energy (Exec.

The lawsuit argues that the wholesale freeze of funding violates federal law, and the nonprofits ask the court to bar the agencies from continuing to pause funding and to disburse funding that was previously frozen. The court blocked the defendant agencies from freezing, halting, or pausing funding payments under the IRA and IIJA, a decision which the defendant agencies appealed to the First Circuit.\nCase Summary: President Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Order 14154 mandates that all agencies immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) that pertain to policies outlined in Section 2 of the EO, which relate to climate change, infrastructure improvement, and public health protection. The EO requires agencies to seek the approval of both the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, who must review and ensure disbursements are consistent with EO\u2019s policies, prior to disbursing funds. OMB issued a memo to that effect. \nThe six Plaintiffs are three nonprofits with environmental and conservation missions, one conservation district, one nonprofit community development corporation, and a network of nonprofit organizations. They are suing the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and their respective Secretaries. They are also suing the Environmental Protection Agency and its Administrator, the Office of Management and Budget and its Director, and the Director of the National Economic Council. \nFollowing the Executive Order and the OMB memo, the named federal agencies paused all funding appropriated by the IRA and IIJA. The plaintiffs argue that this \u201cfreeze first, ask questions later\u201d approach violates the Administrative Procedure Act because it (1) is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion; (2) exceeds statutory authority; and (3) is contrary to the law. \nThe Plaintiffs seek to have the OMB Memo held unlawful to the extent that it directs agencies to freeze all funds authorized by the IRA and IIJA. They also request a stay preventing the federal agencies from continuing the freeze and requiring them to disburse the funds previously frozen. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 17, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, claiming that they are highly likely to show that the defendants\u2019 actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act and that the defendants\u2019 actions, if not enjoined, will continue to cause serious and irreparable harms to the plaintiffs.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 27, the defendants filed a memorandum in opposition to the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction. They claim that plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not properly before the court, there are no cognizable Administrative Procedure Act claims, and that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims fail on the merits, so the motion for preliminary injunction should be denied.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 31, the plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction, claiming that the plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to succeed on the merits on each of their three claims, that they have put forward evidence of ongoing irreparable harm, and that the public interest favors immediate relief.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 15, Judge Mary McElroy granted a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 30, the defendants appealed Judge McElroy\u2019s Apr. 15 preliminary inunction order to the First Circuit.\nUpdate 6: On May 27, defendants moved to hold its appeal in abeyance due to the overlap of issues with New York v. Trump (25-1236, 25-1413), which is also on appeal with the First Circuit.

They seek restoration of the frozen funds, an injunction against further interference, and a declaration that the funding freeze is unlawful.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20 and Feb. 26, 2025, President Donald Trump signed three executive orders that froze or terminated congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Plaintiffs, a group of nonprofit organizations and municipalities, filed suit against President Trump and various federal agencies, alleging that the executive orders unlawfully violate the First Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act, and other constitutional and statutory provisions by preventing the disbursement of funds for environmental, agricultural, and infrastructure projects. Further, they argue that the administration\u2019s actions have caused significant financial harm, disrupted community projects, and undermined congressional intent. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief asserting that the funding freeze is unlawful, injunctions to prevent further interference with grant disbursements, and the restoration of previously frozen funds. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 26, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to include additional Plaintiffs Earth Island Institute and Organic Association of Kentucky and their related factual allegations, additional grants that have been frozen, and additional Defendants the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Secretary of the DOE Chris Wright. On the same day, Plaintiffs also filed a motion requesting a preliminary injunction to block Defendants from freezing or terminating federal grants. Plaintiffs also filed a motion for expedited discovery from five defendants\u2013the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency Service (DOGE), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), and DOE\u2013that day as well.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 31, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Recent Developments to update the court of factual developments relating to the EPA (one of the Defendants) unilaterally terminating four of the grants in dispute. On Apr. 1, Defendants filed a response to Plaintiffs\u2019 Notice of Recent Developments, opposing any shortening of briefing deadlines or hearing timelines. \nUpdate 3: On Apr. 2, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for expedited discovery. On Apr. 3, Plaintiffs filed their reply in support of their motion for expedited discovery.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 7, Judge Richard Gergel narrowed Plaintiffs\u2019 expedited discovery requests to a single request and ordered the five defendant agencies named in Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to produce all documents from Jan. 20, 2025 to present relating to the freeze, pause, and/or termination of any of the grants identified by Plaintiffs in their motion for expedited discovery.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 9, the Court denied the administration\u2019s motion to reconsider and stay an expedited discovery order. The court granted the motion to strike discovery from  DOGE. \nUpdate 6: On Apr. 16, Plaintiffs filed their reply in support of motion for preliminary injunction to block Defendants from freezing or terminating federal grants. \nUpdate 7: On Apr. 17, DOE, DOT, USDA and the EPA, replied to the order for expedited discovery with responsive documents. The EPA  requested an extension to provide the remainder of responsive documents by Apr. 18 and subsequently requested an additional extension until Apr. 21.\nUpdate 8: On June 5, a federal appeals court granted the administration\u2019s request to stop a district court order that had restored 32 federal grants supporting environmental and infrastructure projects. The order allows the administration to continue suspending the grants while the appeal proceeds. 2025-06-05\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Unleashing American Energy (Exec.

They argue that the agency unlawfully froze $20 billion in Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and that CitiBank stopped honoring its contracts with the banks for pollution-related projects. They seek restoration of access to the funds, an injunction against further interference, and a declaration that the freeze is unlawful.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to freeze or terminate congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Plaintiffs, four \u201cgreen\u201d banks that provide financial services to pollution-reducing projects, filed suit against Citibank and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), alleging that the EPA unlawfully blocked access to $20 billion in Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants. Further, the plaintiffs allege that, due to the EPA\u2019s pressure, Citibank is no longer honoring contracts with the Plaintiffs meant for pollution-reduction projects. They argue that these actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act, the Impoundment Control Act, and constitutional separation of powers under the Spending Clause and the Tenth Amendment. They seek declaratory relief affirming the freeze as unlawful, injunctions to restore access to funds and prevent further interference, and contractual relief compelling Citibank to release the funds.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 24, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. In this motion, Plaintiffs requested that (1) the court convert the relief extended in the temporary restraining order (TRO) issued in the related case of Climate United Fund v. Citibank to a preliminary injunction, and (2) further enjoin Citibank from violating its obligations to disburse funds.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 25, this case was consolidated with Climate United Fund v.

They seek restoration of access to the funds, an injunction against further interference, and a declaration that the freeze is unlawful.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, President Trump issued an executive order to freeze or terminate congressionally appropriated funds under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Plaintiffs include IRA grant recipient farms and non-profit organizations dedicated to advancing environmental issues. Following the EO, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed government agencies to temporarily pause all activities related to the disbursement of all federal financial assistance. Despite OMB rescinding this direction, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) allegedly continues to withhold funds from Plaintiffs.\nWhile courts have issued temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions to Defendants regarding the frozen funds, Plaintiffs have yet to receive their grants. This freeze of funds allegedly continues to impact Plaintiffs\u2019 ability to operate their respective businesses and organizations. Plaintiffs allege this freeze of funds violates the Administrative Procedure Act (contrary to law as an unlawful impoundment; and \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d conduct), the constitutional separation of powers under the Spending Clause, and the Take Care Clause of the Constitution. They seek declaratory relief stating the freeze is unlawful, and injunctions to restore access to funds and prevent any further interference.2025-03-13\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Unleashing American Energy (Exec.

Dept. of Transport et al (W.D. Wash.)\n\nCase No. 2:25-cv-00848\nComplaint2025-05-07Overview:  Sixteen states and the District of Columbia are suing to stop the Trump administration\u2019s effort to block federal funds related to electric vehicle infrastructure that Congress already approved.\n\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order No. 14,154, Unleashing American Energy, which declared it the policy of the United States to \u201celiminate the electric vehicle (EV) mandate\u201d and directed all federal agencies to immediately pause disbursement of funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), including those allocated to the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. In response, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) pulled back previous approvals of every state\u2019s EV Infrastructure Deployment Plan and rescinded all NEVI guidance. On May 7, sixteen states and the District of Columbia challenged the FHWA to prevent it from implementing the Administration\u2019s directive and its February 6, 2025 letter pausing funding. The complaint alleges that the Administration\u2019s actions unlawfully withhold congressionally appropriated funds, interfere with state\u2019s statutory entitlements to NEVI formula funding, and prevent states\u2019 efforts to implement climate, transportation, and public health policy. Plaintiffs allege violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, Spending Clause, the Take Care Clause, separation of powers principles, and the ultra vires doctrine. They seek declaratory relief that the FHWA\u2019s actions are unlawful and permanent injunctions that prohibit the Administration from withholding NEVI funds in contravention of the IIJA. \nUpdate 1: On May 7, Plaintiffs filed their motion for a preliminary injunction, alleging that FHWA\u2019s revocation of approved state EV infrastructure plans and categorical withholding of NEVI funds violates statutory mandates, exceeds agency authority, causes ongoing irreparable harm to states\u2019 transportation and climate programs, and upsets the balance of powers, thus warranting immediate judicial intervention.\nUpdate 2: On May 22, seven nonprofit environmental and public interest organizations filed a Motion to Intervene as Intervenor-Plaintiffs. The Parties allege that they seek to protect their interests in the federal EV charging program, which they argue is critical for reducing pollution and ensuring access to reliable charging infrastructure. The Parties move to intervene by alleging that the federal government\u2019s suspension of the program directly harms their members and that no current party in the case fully represents their interests.\nUpdate 3: On May 28, Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, alleging that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not ready for court review because no final agency action has been taken and any alleged harm is speculative, given that FHWA is still developing updated guidance and has not denied future funding. They contend that pausing new obligations while revising guidance is lawful, reasonable, and within FHWA\u2019s authority, and that Plaintiffs have failed to show irreparable harm or justify the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 4: On June 4, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for preliminary injunction, alleging that the case is ripe because the federal government has already taken final, harmful action by revoking approved state plans and halting the obligation of NEVI funds, causing immediate and irreparable harm. They also alleged that these actions, and not any future guidance, form the basis of the suit. \nUpdate 5: On June 24, Judge Tana Lin granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction, holding that Plaintiffs had established a likelihood of success on the merits as to the APA claims and that all Plaintiffs except District of Columbia, Minnesota and Vermont had established irreparable harm, but denying the motion with respect to these three Plaintiffs as they had not proffered any evidence demonstrating irreparable harm.

The plaintiff is Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL),  a nonprofit news organization that is funded by Congress with grants distributed through USAGM. RFE/RL has brought a suit against USAGM to block it from withholding the congressional funds and to require it to disburse the funds. On Mar. 24, USAGM began to disburse a portion of the funds for the period of Mar. 1-14, 2025. USAGM has since withdrawn its letter withholding the grant funds from RFE/RL, but RFE/RL alleges that USAGM has yet to fully disburse those funds. The court has issued temporary restraining orders blocking the termination of grants and requiring the immediate disbursement of plaintiff\u2019s April funding. USAGM has since appealed the court\u2019s order requiring the immediate disbursement of plaintiff\u2019s April funding to the D.C. Circuit. On May 1, the DC Circuit imposed a temporary administrative block to the district court\u2019s order. On May 7, the DC Circuit en banc blocked the panel\u2019s May 1 decision.\nCase Summary:Case Summary: On Mar. 14, President Trump passed an Executive Order (EO) that eliminated non-mandatory functions and sections of seven federal agencies and required them to reduce mandatory functions and personnel to the legal minimum, with the agencies being the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in the Smithsonian Institution, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, and the Minority Business Development Agency. Plaintiff Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (\u201cRFE/RL\u201d) is a private, nonprofit news organization funded by congressionally appropriated funds distributed by USAGM. On Mar. 15, Kari Lake, a Senior Advisor to the Acting Chief Executive Officer of USAGM, purported to terminate RFE/RL\u2019s grant agreement on the basis of the Mar. 14 EO. USAGM has informed RFE/RL that it will not disburse to RFE/RL its congressionally appropriated funds for Mar. 1, 2025, through Sep. 30, 2025. Defendants are USAGM, Kari Lake, and Victor Morales, Acting Chief Executive Officer of USAGM.\nPlaintiff requests that the court find USAGM\u2019s impoundment of RFE/RL\u2019s congressionally appropriated funds and termination of RFE/RL\u2019s grant agreement to be unlawful, to obligate USAGM to disburse to RFE/RL the appropriations of ~$7.5 million covering Mar. 1-14, 2025, and ~$70 million covering Mar. 15-Sep. 30, 2025, and to issue a permanent injunction. Plaintiff\u2019s counts include an alleged violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (for \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d action and action in violation of statutory non-discretionary duty); the Presentment, Spending, and Take Care Clauses; and the separation of powers.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 19, Plaintiff filed a motion requesting a TRO and preliminary injunction on the grounds of irreparable harm to Plaintiff\u2019s operations, employee safety, and reputation, and the likelihood that Plaintiff will succeed on its Administrative Procedure Act and constitutional claims. On Mar. 21, the Government filed an opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a TRO and preliminary injunction. On Mar. 23, Plaintiff filed a further reply in support of its request for a TRO and preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 24, USAGM filed a motion stating that it is taking the administrative steps to disburse $7,464,559, the amount sought by Plaintiff for work completed during the period from Mar. 1-14, 2025. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 25, Judge Royce Lamberth granted a temporary restraining order.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 26, the Defendants\u2019 submitted a Notice of Withdrawal of Grant Termination. The notice states, \u201cPlaintiff has secured the primary relief\u2014withdrawing the termination of its grant agreement\u2014that it requested in the complaint. Now that Plaintiff has received that relief, Defendants\u2019 position is that this matter is now moot.\u201d\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 28,  Plaintiff submitted a response to Defendants\u2019 Mar. 26 Notice, asserting the case is not moot in light of Defendants\u2019 withdrawal of the termination of the grant agreement because Plaintiff\u2019s complaint seeks the additional relief of the full disbursement of the grant funds that have yet to be addressed by Defendants. Plaintiff also reiterated their request that the Court grant its preliminary injunction motion.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 31, Plaintiff reaffirmed its request that the court enter a further TRO allowing Plaintiff to continue its operations without the requirement to \u201crecover\u201d and \"promptly refund[] to USAGM\u201d the funds spent in April because Defendants have yet to approve Plaintiff\u2019s April 2025 financial plan.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 8, Judge Lamberth extended the TRO for an additional 14 days pending the presentation of a new grant agreement to RFE/RL and a status update on said grant agreement.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 9, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a further TRO \u201cto immediately disburse to RFE/RL the amount of RFE/RL\u2019s congressionally appropriate funds\u201d for April 2025. In a memorandum supporting the motion, Plaintiffs assert that new grant conditions by Defendants are unlawful.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 10, Defendants filed a motion to dissolve the TRO, asserting that no party had requested the court\u2019s extension and that new grant terms had rendered the TRO moot.\nUpdate 10: On Apr. 11, Plaintiff filed a motion opposing Defendants\u2019 motion to dissolve the TRO, both on the merits and because of Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new TRO.\nUpdate 11: On Apr. 13, Defendants filed a reply supporting their motion to dissolve the TRO.\nUpdate 12: On Apr. 14, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding additional delta and two additional claims for relief, alleging violations of the APA, for unlawfully withheld agency actions and that USAGM\u2019s onerous grant conditions are arbitrary and capricious and unreasonable on their face.\nUpdate 13: On Apr. 22, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting that the Court  order Defendants to take all steps necessary to ensure USAGM is party to a grant agreement with Plaintiff that does not contain unlawful, unreasonable, or unworkable conditions and that provides all funds congressionally appropriated for Plaintiff through Sept. 30, 2025. Defendants opposed this motion on Apr. 25 and noted Plaintiffs\u2019 request is out of the court\u2019s jurisdiction because the parties are currently negotiating a new grant agreement. Plaintiff replied to Defendants\u2019 opposition on Apr. 27 and urged the court to grant the preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 14: On Apr. 29, Judge Lamberth granted Plaintiff\u2019s Apr. 9 motion for a TRO.

Voice of America (VOA) is a media outlet under USAGM. VOA journalists, Reporters without Borders, and numerous unions brought a suit against USAGM to block the dismantling of USAGM. The court agreed to temporarily block the dismantling of USAGM. This case was then  transferred from the Southern District of New York to Washington, D.C.Following the transfer, the court blocked the dismantling of USAGM and ordered the reinstatement of funds, however defendant Kari Lake has appealed this order to the Court of Appeals for the D.C.

Voice of America (VOA) is a media outlet under USAGM. The current director of VOA and three VOA journalists brought a suit against USAGM to permanently or at least temporarily block the dismantling of VOA and restore the jobs of all employees placed on administrative leave so that VOA\u2019s broadcasting activities can resume. On Apr. 22, the court blocked USAGM from dismantling VOA in response to Trump\u2019s EO.

Voice of America (VOA) is a government-funded media outlet under the USAGM. Michael Abramowitz, the current director of VOA, and three VOA journalists, including two whose visas depend on their employment with VOA, sued Kari Lake (Senior Advisor to the Acting CEO of USAGM), Victor Morales (Acting CEO of USAGM), and USAGM alleging that the dismantling of USAGM was unlawful. Specifically, plaintiffs argue that the defendants\u2019 conduct violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the separation of powers clause of the Constitution, the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, and exceeds their statutory and constitutional authority. Plaintiffs seek a temporary restraining order and a preliminary and permanent injunction to permanently or at least temporarily enjoin defendants from terminating VOA employees and dismantling VOA and to restore the jobs of all employees placed on administrative leave so that VOA\u2019s broadcasting activities can resume.\nUpdate 1: On March 28, Defendants filed their opposition to plaintiff\u2019s motion for preliminary relief, opposing plaintiff\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) or preliminary injunction. Defendants argued that Plaintiffs have not met the burden required to justify a TRO or preliminary injunction, and that the court should require Plaintiffs to post a bond commensurate with the scope of any temporary order (which Defendants suggested should be in excess of $15 million in this case).\nUpdate 2: On April 1, 2025, Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s proposed schedule and motion to stay proceedings. Defendants moved to stay all proceedings pending the outcome of plaintiff\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction in Widakuswara v. Lake, Civ. A. No. 25-2390 (S.D.N.Y.

OTF has asked the court to block USAGM from withholding funds permanently or temporarily while the case proceeds. USAGM has since withdrawn its termination of funding and has begun to release grant funds. OTF has since asked the court to block USAGM from interfering with or otherwise preventing OTF from obtaining its congressionally appropriated funds. The court has since approved a temporary block.\n\nCase Summary: On Mar. 14, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order that eliminated non-mandatory functions and sections of seven federal agencies, including the United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM), and required them to reduce mandatory functions and personnel to the legal minimum. \nPlaintiff is Open Technology Fund (OTF), a non-profit organization with the goal of advancing global internet freedom that is funded by Congress with grants distributed through USAGM. On Mar. 15, Kari Lake, a Senior Advisor to the Acting Chief Executive Officer of USAGM, purported to terminate OTF\u2019s grant agreement on the basis of the Mar. 14 EO.

On Jun. 8, the court denied a preliminary order to stop the government action while the case proceeds in litigation.\n\nCase Summary: On Apr. 28, Trent Morse, Deputy Director of Presidential  Personnel, allegedly sent an email to three of the Board members of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), asserting that President Trump had terminated their positions on the Board. On Apr. 29, the three individual board members and CPB brought suit against Trump, Morse, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and several other officials seeking (1) a judicial declaration that the email had no legal effect and (2) a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) blocking defendants from taking actions to give effect to the email or otherwise seeking to interfere with or control the governance and operations of the CPB. The plaintiffs assert that the President has no authority to remove or terminate CPB Board members, because they contend that the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 (the CPB Act), legal precedent, and government guidance make clear that CPB was established as \u201ca private corporation [to] be created to facilitate the development of public telecommunications and to \nafford maximum protection from extraneous interference and control.\u201d \nThe plaintiffs assert that defendants\u2019 actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act as an excess of statutory authority; a violation of the separation of powers; and a violation of the Presentment, Appropriations, and Take Care Clauses.\nUpdate 1: On May 6, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 TRO motion, asserting that Trump has the lawful authority to remove CPB Board members.

Each of the plaintiff member stations also receives federal funding from the CPB, some of which is used to pay membership and programming fees to NPR.\nOn May 1, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14290, entitled \u201cEnding Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media\u201d. The EO directs federal agencies as well as the CPB to withhold all federal funding, direct or indirect, from NPR and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) as well as ensuring that local stations that receive grants from CPB do not use those funds to acquire NPR or PBS programming, and to revise existing grant agreements to prohibit grantees from funding NPR or PBS. The EO stated that it was expressly predicated on the view that their news was not \u201cfair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.\u201d An accompanying Fact Sheet confirmed that the EO was based on the opinion that NPR and PBS distributed \u201cleft-wing propaganda\u201d and listed specific news coverage and editorial choices with which the President disagrees. The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) subsequently terminated a grant award to NPR in compliance with the EO. \nPlaintiffs sued, contending that the EO is retaliatory and viewpoint-based discrimination, and that it interferes with plaintiff local member stations\u2019 freedom of expressive association and editorial discretion by preventing them from affiliating with NPR. They argue that the EO violates specific requirements of the Act as enacted by Congress, statutes governing the NEA\u2019s grant-making functions, the Separation of Powers and the Spending Clause of the Constitution by unilaterally imposing restrictions and conditions on funds in contravention of Congress, and the First Amendment\u2019s guarantees of freedom and speech and of the press. They also argue that the EO violates the Due Process Clause by disregarding NPR\u2019s reliance interests in its continued eligibility for such funding without process and due to vagueness, that it violates the APA for lack of statutory authority and violations of the Constitution, and is ultra vires.\nPlaintiffs seek an order declaring the EO and all actions implementing it unlawful and unconstitutional and that the NEA and the CPB may not condition the receipt of funding or withhold funding from NPR and any local member station on the basis of the EO, and an order preliminarily and permanently enjoining the implementation of the EO.2025-05-27\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Governance and Defunding Global Media and Global Internet Freedom (Executive Order 14217 - Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy) (Executive Order 14238 - Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy) (Executive Order 14290 - Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media)Public Broadcasting Service v. Trump (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01722Complaint2025-05-30Overview:  The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and Lakeland PBS, one of its member stations in Northern Minnesota, filed suit challenging EO 14290, which withholds federal funding from PBS and National Public Radio (NPR). Plaintiffs argue that the order violates the Public Broadcasting Act  and their First Amendment rights. \nCase Summary: Through the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, (the \u201cAct\u201d) Congress established the infrastructure for public television, including the appropriation of federal funding to support independent public broadcasting and the creation of a separate private entity, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), to act as an independent structure between the government and the recipient of funds. The Act expressly mandates that CPB should not be an agency of the government in order to \u201cafford maximum protection from extraneous interference and control.\u201d\nPBS, a private non-profit membership organization comprising 336 local public television broadcast studios who pay dues to PBS, provides a broad array of commercial-free educational television programming and services throughout the United States. PBS produces, acquires and distributes programming and makes it available to its member stations, including Lakeland, and also serves as a source of support for its member stations through the procurement and distribution of development training, brand management, and other services, as well as providing a public safety wireless emergency alert system. A portion of PBS\u2019s funding comes from membership fees and fees for providing services to member stations, with the majority of the remaining funding coming from federal grants. \nMember stations, including Lakeland, also receive federal funding from the CPB, which is used both to produce local programming and to pay pay membership and programming fees to PBS. Lakeland relies on PBS for both a large percentage of its programming and for the support PBS offers its member stations.\nOn May 1, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14290, entitled \u201cEnding Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media\u201d. The EO directs federal agencies as well as the CPB to withhold all federal funding, direct or indirect, from PBS and NPR as well as ensuring that local stations that receive grants from CPB not use those funds. to acquire PBS or NPR programming, and to revise existing grant agreements to prohibit grantees from funding PBS or NPR. The EO stated that it was expressly predicated on the view that their news was not \u201cfair, accurate, or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens.\u201d An accompanying Fact Sheet confirmed that the EO was based on the opinion that NPR and PBS distributed \u201cleft-wing propaganda\u201d and listed specific news coverage and editorial choices with which the President disagrees. On May 2, Defendant United States Department of Education (ED) notified CPB that in compliance with the EO it was terminating a federal award under which CPB had granted funds to PBS for educational programs.\nThe Plaintiffs sued, arguing that the EO violates the First Amendment\u2019s guarantees of freedom of speech, freedom of the press and editorial discretion and is ultra vires conduct as it violates specific requirements of the Act as enacted by Congress. They contend that the EO is retaliatory and viewpoint-based discrimination, and that it also violates the First Amendment by imposing unconstitutional restrictions and requirements as a condition of funding. They also argue that the EO violates the Administrative Procedure Act as arbitrary and capricious and contrary to constitutional rights.\nPlaintiffs seek an order declaring the EO and all actions implementing with respect to PBS and PBS member stations unlawful and unconstitutional, and injunctive and expedited relief barring the termination of the funding.2025-05-30\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Termination of public health grantsState of Colorado v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (D .R.I.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00121Complaint2025-04-01Overview:Numerous states and state officials have challenged the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s (HHS) Mar. 24, 2025 termination of $11 billion in public health funding. The states allege terminating this funding violates the Administrative Procedure Act and have asked the court to vacate and enjoin the funding terminations. The court has since temporarily blocked the funding terminations.\nCase Summary: Beginning on Mar. 24, 2025, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) terminated $11 billion in public health funding on the ground that the funds were no longer necessary because they were appropriated under various laws responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. Plaintiffs are 20 states, the District of Columbia, and two Democratic governors. They assert that Congress appropriated these funds to strengthen public health programs and that the funds were not limited to addressing the Covid-19 pandemic, and that Congress and HHS continued to make these funds available even after the end of the public health emergency was declared in May 2023. Plaintiffs allege that these terminations of funding are arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (as \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d conduct and contrary to law, for example, by allegedly unlawfully applying the \u201cfor cause\u201d provisions of  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300x-55). They request that the Court declare the terminations unlawful and enjoin Defendants from implementing and enforcing the terminations.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 1, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to block Defendants from implementing and enforcing the public health terminations. \nUpdate 2: On Apr. 5, Judge Mary McElroy granted Plaintiff\u2019s request for a TRO against Defendants, which required Defendants to immediately cease the withholding of funds and implementing or enforcing the funding terminations.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 8, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs added an additional claim under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (alleging Defendant\u2019s public health funding decision is contrary to law) as well as claims for the violation of the Separation of Powers, Spending Clause, and an allegation that Defendants\u2019 actions are ultra vires violations.\nOn that same day, Plaintiff States filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to block Defendants from enforcing or implementing the decision to terminate funding for Plaintiff States and their local health jurisdictions.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 14, Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, alleging the court lacks jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The next day, on Apr. 15, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction and noted Defendants failed to identify any statutory basis for the authority it exercised in implementing and enforcing the terminations.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 24, Defendants submitted a supplemental brief in support of its Apr. 14 opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. Defendants assert that HHS complied with Congress\u2019s direction to make allocated amounts available to the Plaintiff states as part of the broad appropriation of funds in response to COVID-19 and consequently its decision to terminate the grants was not in violation of the Constitution.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 29, the Plaintiff States submitted a supplemental brief in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction, flagging that Defendants\u2019 supplemental brief did not address any of the Plaintiff States\u2019 constitutional claims.2025-04-29\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Termination of public health grantsPlanned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. v.

Md.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-02114Complaint2025-07-01Overview:  Multiple cities, physicians organizations, and civil society groups have challenged the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019s (HHS) implementation of new rules that significantly undermine the availability of insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The new rules, published as the \u201c2025 Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Rule,\u201d (the 2025 Rule) revise many existing requirements and procedures to narrow insurance access: adding monthly fees to encourage individuals to either leave or validate their enrollment in low-income insurance plans, increasing maximum out-of-pocket costs for ACA beneficiaries by adjusting calculation methods, shortening open enrollment periods for beneficiaries to enroll in insurance, reducing the required minimum coverage of insurance plans on ACA marketplaces, and blocking individuals who owe prior insurance debts from enrolling in healthcare coverage.  The plaintiff cities and organizations allege that these rule changes are \u201ca clear continuation of the prior Trump Administration\u2019s yearslong effort to undermine the [Affordable Care Act]\u201d and that they violate the Administrative Procedure Act by conflicting with the text and purpose of the ACA and by arbitrarily and capriciously changing ACA enrollment procedures without evidence supporting such changes. They request removal of the 2025 Rule due to these legal violations. \nCase Summary: On June 20, 2025, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) issued a new set of rules and standards, entitled the \u201c2025 Marketplace Integrity and Affordability Final Rule\u201d (the 2025 Rule), that significantly altered the requirements and procedures for individuals to enroll in health insurance on marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (42 U.S.C. Section 157). The numerous changes aimed to limit costs and to minimize fraud in the insurance system by: reducing the number of individuals enrolling in insurance with unresolved insurance debts, offering insurers more flexibility regarding the value of the coverage they provide to beneficiaries, incentivizing beneficiaries to confirm their income by imposing monthly fees for non-confirmation, shortening enrollment periods, and increasing beneficiary cost-sharing responsibilities. Plaintiffs \u2013 the cities of Columbus, Baltimore, and Chicago, and the civil society organizations, Doctors for America and Main Street Alliance \u2013 claim that these rule modifications violate multiple provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. Section 706(2)(A)). First, they allege that the actions are contrary to the statutory text of the ACA, particularly Section 1554\u2019s prohibition on \u201cany unreasonable barriers to the ability of individuals to obtain appropriate medical care.\u201d Second, they allege that the 2025 Rule is arbitrary and capricious given both its flagrant ignorance of evidence concerning the negative impacts of the rule changes and its failure to adequately respond to comments filed by interested parties. Plaintiffs seek temporary and permanent injunctions vacating the 2025 Rule. 2025-07-02\n\n\nGovernment Grants, Loans and AssistanceExecutive Action: Access to Health CareThe Family Planning Association of Maine v.

US Department of Agriculture (D.Me.) \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00131\nComplaint2025-04-07Overview: On April 7, 2025 the State of Maine sued the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) claiming that it unlawfully froze federal funds allocated to Maine to feed schoolchildren, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The USDA froze the funds on April 2 on the basis that by permitting transgender girls and women to participate in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s school sports, Maine is allegedly in violation of Title IX of the Civil Rights Act and is not in compliance with two Executive Orders by President Trump. The court has since temporarily blocked USDA from freezing these funds and has ordered the funds to be released to Maine and on May 2 Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case with prejudice.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued Executive Order 14168, stating that there are only two sexes, male and female, and that they are determined by immutable biological factors at conception. On Feb. 5, the administration issued Executive Order 14201, directing the federal government to interpret and enforce Title IX under the sex definitions provided in Executive Order 14168, which would bar transgender women and girls from competing in women\u2019s sports.\nOn April 2, Maine received a letter from Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, stating that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) was freezing funds for certain technological functions in schools in Maine, as well as reviewing all research and education-related grants and  funding. The letter stated that in order to continue to receive taxpayer dollars from USDA, Maine must demonstrate compliance with \u201cTitle IX\u2019s protection of female student athletes from having to compete with or against males.\u201d Despite commitments from Secretary Rollins that this freeze would not affect funding to feed schoolchildren, on April 3, Maine\u2019s Child Nutrition Program was allegedly unable to access various federal funds. \nPlaintiff alleges that the funding freeze is a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Specifically, they argue that the freeze is  \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and taken without observance of procedure required by law, as Secretary Rollins allegedly did not follow numerous required procedures, including notification, investigation, and related hearings. Plaintiff has requested the court vacate the funding freeze and issue a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining the USDA from impeding Maine\u2019s access to federal funds based on the alleged violation of Title IX without following all legally required procedures.\nUpdate 1: Immediately after filing its complaint on Apr. 7, the Plaintiff filed a motion for an emergency temporary restraining order (TRO) to temporarily block Defendants from terminating, freezing, or otherwise interfering with Maine\u2019s access to federal funds allocated to Maine based on Maine\u2019s alleged violation of Title IX. Plaintiff amended its complaint the next day, but did not add any additional claims against Defendants.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 9, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s motion for an emergency TRO. Plaintiffs replied to Defendant\u2019s opposition on Apr. 10.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 11, Judge John Woodcock, Jr. granted Plaintiff\u2019s motion for an emergency TRO through Apr. 25, 2025. This order requires Defendants to immediately unfreeze and release federal funding to Maine that has been withheld due to the alleged violation of Title IX and was later extended through May 9, 2025.\nUpdate 4: On May 2, Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed this action with prejudice.2025-05-02\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Housing of transgender inmates (Executive Order 14168)Maria Moe v.

She argues that the EO violates her constitutional rights and federal law, and exceeds BOP\u2019s scope of authority. She has asked the court to stop the EO\u2019s implementation. The court granted her request and has temporarily stopped the EO, requiring prison officials to maintain her medical care and to not transfer her. The case has since been transferred to the court local to where the woman is currently in custody.\nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s Executive Order mandates that federal inmates be housed according to sex defined as \u201cimmutable biological classification,\u201d regardless of gender identity, and directs the Bureau of Prisons not to expend federal funds on gender-affirming care. The plaintiff, Maria Moe, is a transgender female federal inmate who was placed in a Special Housing Unit to await transfer to a men\u2019s facility. The suit seeks to enjoin the Executive Order on the basis that it violates the 5th Amendment by discriminating against transgender individuals on the basis of sex and gender identity; the 8th Amendment by subjecting Moe to risk to life and dignity; the Rehabilitation Act by failing to accommodate Moe\u2019s gender dysphoria; and the Administrative Procedure Act by doing so in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\nUpdate 1: On Jan. 26, the judge reportedly issued a temporary restraining order requiring prison officials to maintain Moe's medical care and not to transfer her from the general population of the women's facility.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 7, the judge issued an order transferring the case \u201cto the United States District Court for the district in which [Moe] is currently confined\u201d and terminating proceedings in the District of Massachusetts.

The plaintiffs are three transgender women federal inmates, have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and are housed in female facilities. All have been informed that they will be transferred imminently to men\u2019s facilities. The suit seeks a declaratory judgement that the executive order violates the plaintiffs\u2019 rights under the 5th Amendment by discriminating on the basis of sex; the 8th Amendment by failure to protect through exposing plaintiffs to risk of serious harm and by cruel and unusual punishment by refusing necessary medical care; the Rehabilitation Act by failing to accommodate plaintiffs\u2019 gender dysphoria and disability discrimination; and the Administrative Procedure Act by doing so in an arbitrary and capricious manner.

The plaintiffs seek to represent all current and future BOP inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria who are receiving or would receive gender-affirming care if not for the EO.  The lawsuit argues that the EO violates the Constitution, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs have asked the court to block BOP from enforcing the EO while litigation proceeds, which the court did on a preliminary basis on June 3. \nCase Summary: Trump\u2019s Executive Order 14168 (\u201cEO\u201d), issued on January 20, 2025, mandates that federal inmates be housed according to sex defined as \u201cimmutable biological classification,\u201d regardless of gender identity, and directs the Bureau of Prisons not to expend federal funds on gender-affirming care.\nPlaintiffs, three transgender individuals currently incarcerated in federal prisons who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria, brought the lawsuit to represent all current and future federal inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria who are impacted by the executive order's ban on gender-affirming care.\nThe lawsuit argues that the EO violates their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment (protection against cruel and unusual punishment), Equal Protection Clause, Rehabilitation Act, and Administrative Procedure Act.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 17, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, to stay agency action, and for provisional class certification for the purpose of emergency relief.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 28, Defendants filed a response to Plaintiffs\u2019 Mar. 17 motions, requesting that the court deny Plaintiffs\u2019 motions for a preliminary injunction and class certification.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 4, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for preliminary injunction, to stay agency action and for class certification.\nUpdate 4: On June 3, Judge Royce C.

The order rescinds prior policy allowing transgender individuals to serve openly if they meet military standards. This order categorically prohibits both enlistment and continued service, deeming transgender individuals incompatible with military standards of \u201ctroop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity.\u201d The plaintiffs are a group of active duty transgender service members and prospective or current enlistees. They argue that the categorical exclusion of this class of individuals from military service violates equal protection under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause because the policy is arbitrary and lacks a legitimate government interest.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 3, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction against implementation of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 4, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO against implementation of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 3: On Feb, 5, the court ordered the Government to notify plaintiffs and the court of any Department of Defense policy or guidance implementing the Executive Order. If any such action is taken, the court will entertain Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a TRO.\nUpdate 4: In response to the Court\u2019s order to update any policies or guidance implementing Executive Order 14168 (\u201cDefending Women from Gender Extremism\u2026\u201d) or Executive Order 14183 (\u201cPrioritizing Miliary\u2026\u201d), the government filed a memorandum for Senior Pentagon Leadership Commanders of the Combatant Commands Defense Agency and DoD Field Activity Directors, released on February 26, 2025, Subject: Additional Guidance on Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness. The Memorandum requires updating of military guidance as it relates to transgender service members and provides a new policy, \u201cService Members and Applicants for Military Service who Have a Current Diagnosis or History of, or Exhibit Symptoms Consistent with, Gender Dysphoria.\u201d The new policy states that \u201cService members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria will be processed for separation from military service,\u201d and orders that \u201csteps to identify Service members who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria within 30 days of this memorandum.\u201d It also states that \u201chistory of cross-sex hormone therapy or sex reassignment or genital reconstruction surgery as treatment for gender dysphoria or in pursuit of a sex transition, is disqualifying,\u201d including already-extended offers of admission to military academies, and applies restrictions on individuals post-separation benefits eligibility. \nWhile waivers are available, the applicant \u201cmust be willing and able to adhere to all applicable standards, including the standards associated with the applicant's sex.\u201d\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 18, Judge Ana Reyes granted Plaintiff\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction, extending to all transgender service members facing the same irreparable harm. The Court stays its Order until Mar. 21, 2025, to provide Defendants time to consider filing an emergency stay with the D.C. Circuit. \nUpdate 6: On Mar. 24, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to include additional plaintiffs. Plaintiffs Jamie Hash, Vera Wolf, Hunter Marquez, Ashley Davis, and Samuel Ahearn also filed a motion requesting a TRO to block enforcement of the EO and Department of Defense memoranda and preserve the status quo, on the basis that Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their Fifth Amendment claim and likely to face irreparable harm. The motion states: \u201cIn light of this Court\u2019s March 18, 2025, order granting a nationwide preliminary injunction of the Military Ban, ECF No. 88, which the Court administratively stayed pending Defendants\u2019 Motions, see Minute Order (Mar. 21, 2025), this Court should temporarily restrain enforcement of the Military Ban with respect to these specific adverse actions toward Moving Plaintiffs until it resolves Defendants\u2019 Motions on the merits.\u201d\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 26, Defendants filed a notice of appeal to the D.C. Circuit appealing Judge Reyes\u2019 Mar. 18 order renewing the preliminary injunction.  2025-03-26\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Ban on transgender individuals serving in the military (Executive Order 14183)Shilling v.

They argue that the ban is unconstitutional and has asked the court to declare the EO unconstitutional and stop implementation of the EO. The judge temporarily blocked the administration policy, and the court of appeals rejected an appeal of this decision. However, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the district court order while the litigation proceeds.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 27, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order banning transgender individuals from serving in the military. The order rescinds prior policy allowing transgender individuals to serve openly if they meet military standards. Plaintiffs, including active and prospective trans service members and an organization representing transgender military members, argue that the ban violates the equal protection and due process guarantees of the Fifth Amendment and the free speech guarantee of the First Amendment. They seek declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction against enforcement of the executive order.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 19, Plaintiffs filed motion for a preliminary injunction to stop the enforcement of the executive order as to Plaintiffs and other current and aspiring transgender servicemembers. \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 4, Plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 4: Plaintiffs submitted a supplemental brief in support of the motion for a preliminary injunction; the government responded with a brief in opposition to a preliminary injunction on Mar. 14; to which the Plaintiffs replied on Mar. 19.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 27, Judge Benjamin Settle granted a preliminary injunction. He wrote, \u201cThe government has in turn provided no evidence supporting the conclusion that military readiness, unit cohesion, lethality, or any of the other touchstone phrases long used to exclude various groups from service have in fact been adversely impacted by open transgender service under the Austin Policy. The Court can only find that there is none.\u201d \u201cThe government\u2019s arguments are not persuasive, and it is not an especially close question on this record,\u201d Settle stated.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 28, the government appealed the Court\u2019s order granting the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit.\nOn that same day, Trump was dismissed as a defendant in this case.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 31, the Ninth Circuit denied the request for a stay. On Apr. 24, the Defendants appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nUpdate 7: On May 6, the Supreme Court issued a stay (with Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissenting).2025-05-06\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Ban on transgender individuals serving in the military (Executive Order 14183)Ireland v. Hegseth (D. N.J.)\n\nCase no. 1:25-cv-01918Complaint 2025-03-17Overview: Two transgender U.S. Air Force service members have brought a suit seeking to block the Trump administration\u2019s Executive Orders (EOs) banning transgender individuals from enlisting and serving in the military. They argue that the EOs violate their constitutional right to equal treatment. On Mar. 24, a federal judge temporarily blocked implementation of the EOs, finding that they unambiguously violated constitutional protections. \nCase Summary: On Jan. 20 and 27, 2025, President Donald Trump issued EOs reversing the existing policy of the United States Armed Forces by banning transgender people from military service. Plaintiffs Master Sergeant Logan Ireland and Staff Sergeant Nicholas Bear Bade are transgender men who have served as members of the United States Air Force for years. Both Plaintiffs have been placed on administrative absence and have been informed that they only can continue to serve if they do so in their birth sex (i.e., as women). It is not possible for either Plaintiff to serve as a woman because they have medically transitioned and live as men. Plaintiffs believe that involuntary administrative separation proceedings will be initiated against them because of their transgender status by Mar. 26, 2025, given the Trump administration\u2019s EO implementation timeline. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and permanent injunctive relief against the implementation of the EOs and related memoranda, on the basis that they have a constitutional right under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to not be separated from military service based on their transgender status. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 18, Plaintiffs filed a request for a TRO on the grounds of irreparable harm and that Plaintiffs would win on the merits of their Equal Protection claim.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 20, the Government filed an opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a TRO. On Mar. 21, Plaintiffs filed a further reply in support of their request for a TRO. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 24, Judge Christine O\u2019Hearn granted Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a 14-day TRO, finding that the EOs present a clear violation of constitutional rights and that attempting to exhaust administrative procedures would be inadequate to address irreparable injury to the Plaintiffs. \n2025-03-24\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Ban on gender affirming care for individuals under the age of 19 ( Executive Order 14168; Executive Order 14187)PFLAG, Inc. v. Trump (D. Md.)\n\nCase No. 8:25-cv-00337-BAHComplaint2025-02-04Overview: Two nonprofit organizations representing LGBTQ interests and their members sued the Trump administration, challenging an executive order (\u201cEO\u201d) which restricts gender-affirming care for individuals under 19, ended government-provided medical insurance coverage for gender-affirming care, and stops federal funding to institutions which promote \"gender ideology.\" The plaintiffs argue that the EO exceeds the President\u2019s authority and violates multiple constitutional rights including the right to free speech. The plaintiffs have asked the court to declare the EO unconstitutional and unlawful, and stop the implementation of the EO. On March 4, a federal judge preliminarily blocked enforcement of the EO while the case proceeds. The Trump administration appealed this decision to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on Mar. 21. Meanwhile, the plaintiffs asserted that the government had acted in violation of the judge\u2019s order blocking the enforcement of the EO by sending notices which allegedly renewed previous threats to withhold federal funds. The judge disagreed, explaining the current structure of the notices merely advises the agencies that the funding of grants may change in the future.\nCase Summary: On January 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order prohibiting the federal government from expending federal funds to promote \u201cgender ideology,\u201d the idea that gender identity can differ from biological sex. On January 28, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order directing the federal government to bar medical institutes that receive research and education grants, including medical schools and hospitals, from administering gender affirming care to individuals under the age of 19. The order also ended coverage for gender affirming care in government-provided medical benefits, and ordered the Office of Management and Budget to instruct private health insurers that government employee plans were barred from covering such care. Finally, the order directs the Department of Justice to prioritize enforcement against female genital mutilation and develop legislation for a private right of action against medical professionals performing gender-affirming procedures, pursuant to an older statute against female genital mutilation. PFLAG and other plaintiffs filed suit, arguing the orders constitute unconstitutional presidential action in excess of Article II authority; discriminate on the basis of sex and disability in violation of statutes; violate the Fifth Amendment\u2019s equal protection and substantive due process guarantees; and abridge the First Amendment\u2019s free speech clause. Plaintiffs seek to have the orders declared unconstitutional and unlawful, and asking for temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief. \nUpdate 1: On Feb. 5, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO against implementation of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 2: On Feb 13, Judge Brendan Abell Hurson issued a two-week TRO, blocking enforcement of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 18, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 26, Plaintiffs moved to extend the TRO. Judge Hurson extended the TRO until March 5, 2025.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 4, Judge Brendan Hurson granted Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined Defendants from conditioning, withholding, or terminating federal funding based on the fact that a healthcare entity or professional provides gender-affirming medical care to a patient under age 19. \nUpdate 6: On Mar. 7, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for enforcement of the preliminary injunction, asserting that the government violated the injunction by issuing notices renewing threats to withhold federal funds from organizations providing gender-affirming care.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 10, the government filed a memorandum opposing plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion, asserting that the government\u2019s actions \u201cdo not violate this Court\u2019s preliminary injunction\u201d because they do not directly \u201ccondition, withhold, or terminate\u201d aid under the enjoined provisions. In response, plaintiffs filed a memorandum asserting that the government\u2019s notices \u201care overt threats by Defendants that federal funding recipients risk losing their federal funding if they provide gender affirming medical care to a patient under the age of nineteen.\u201d\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 21, the government filed notice that it was appealing the Mar. 4 preliminary injunction in the case to the Fourth Circuit.\nUpdate 9: On Mar. 28, the District Court denied plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion for enforcement of the preliminary injunction. The Court explained that the government\u2019s notices presently do not violate the preliminary injunction order because they merely advise the agencies that grant funding could change in the future.2025-03-28\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Ban on gender affirming care for individuals under the age of 19 ( Executive Order 14168; Executive Order 14187)State of Washington et al. v.

Wash)\n\nCase No. 2:25-cv-00244Complaint (Feb. 7, 2025); Amended Complaint (Feb. 19, 2025)2025-02-07Overview: Three states and three physicians sued the Trump administration, challenging an executive order (\u201cEO\u201d) which restricts gender-affirming care for individuals under 19 and ended government-provided insurance coverage for such care. The plaintiffs argue that the EO violates the Constitution, federal law, and states\u2019 powers. The plaintiffs have asked the court to immediately block implementation of the EO. The court granted their request and blocked the EO, but has permitted the Attorney General to prosecute medical professionals who perform gender-affirming procedures, as \u201cfemale genital mutilation.\u201d \nCase Summary: On Jan. 28, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order directing the federal government to bar medical institutes that receive research and education grants, including medical schools and hospitals, from administering gender affirming care to individuals under the age of 19. The order also ended coverage for gender affirming care in government-provided medical benefits, and ordered the Office of Management and Budget to instruct private health insurers that government employee plans were barred from covering such care. Finally, the order directs the Department of Justice to prioritize enforcement against female genital mutilation and develop legislation for a private right of action against medical professionals performing gender-affirming procedures, pursuant to an older statute against female genital mutilation. Three states and three physicians filed suit, arguing that Executive Order 14187 violates Fifth Amendment equal protection by creating classifications and facially discriminating on the basis of transgender status and sex without sufficient government interest. Plaintiffs also allege that the order violates separation of powers by imposing conditions on the receipt of funding by the plaintiff states\u2019 medical institutions, whereas Congress never authorized such a provision and explicitly barred medical institutions from denying individuals access to federally funded services based on gender dysphoria under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. Finally, the plaintiffs allege that the order violates the Tenth Amendment by regulating and threatening criminal prosecution against certain consensual medical practices, thus unlawfully intruding on the states\u2019 traditional police powers over local public health.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 7, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO against implementation of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 14, Judge Lauren King issued a two-week TRO, blocking enforcement of Section 4 and Section 8(a) of Executive Order 14187 within Plaintiff States; on Feb. 16, the court issued an Opinion in the matter.\nUpdate 3: On Feb. 19, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding the State of Colorado as a plaintiff and a Fifth Amendment Due Process claim for vagueness. Plaintiffs moved separately for a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Executive Order, to which the government responded in opposition on Feb. 28.\nUpdated 4: On Feb. 28, Judge Lauren King issued an order granting the motion for a preliminary injunction, with one exception. The one exception involved Section 8(a) of the EO directing the Attorney General to prioritize \u201cenforcement of protections against female genital mutilation\u201d; but the court found \u201cno credible threat of prosecution\u201d for the plaintiffs. \nUpdate 5: On Mar. 6, plaintiffs filed a motion for the court to hold defendants in contempt of court on shortened time, alleging that defendants tried to circumvent the preliminary injunction by falsely claiming actions taken to withhold funding under the enjoined EOs were actually taken pursuant to other policies. In the alternative, plaintiffs moved for expedited discovery as to whether defendants violated the preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 13, defendants filed a memorandum opposing the motion for contempt, asserting that the relevant decisions to withhold funding were based on preexisting authority and not the enjoined EOs.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 14, plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for contempt or expedited discovery.\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 17, the court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for contempt, but granted expedited discovery on the question of whether the actions were taken pursuant to the enjoined EOs.\nUpdate 9: On Mar. 21, defendants appealed the district court\u2019s partial grant of a preliminary injunction and grant of expedited discovery to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.2025-03-21\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Passport policy targeting transgender people (Executive Order 14168)Orr v.

The plaintiffs have asked the court to declare the EO unconstitutional and unlawful, immediately and permanently stop the EO from implementation, and void actions already taken under the EO. The judge temporarily blocked the order.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order stating that there are only two sexes, male and female, and that they are determined by immutable biological factors at conception. The order directed the Secretary of State to change policies related to documents like passports to align with the order\u2019s definition of sex. The State Department subsequently stopped processing passport applications of individuals seeking to change their sex designation, or who selected an \u201cX\u201d designation. Plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU, sued, arguing the policy is unconstitutional and violates the 5th Amendment\u2019s equal protection guarantee by discriminating on the basis of sex and transgender status; violates the Fifth Amendment by restricting the right of free movement and travel; violates the Fifth Amendment by forcing disclosure of private and intimate information; and violates the First Amendment by compelling the speech of transgender applicants through their passports. Plaintiffs also argue the policy is unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act, as contrary to constitutional rights, powers, and immunities; as an arbitrary and capricious abuse of discretion; and by failing to observe procedures as required by law in instituting the policy without a comment period. They seek a declaratory judgment that the policy is unconstitutional and unlawful; preliminary and permanent injunctions stopping the policy from being implemented; and an order vacating agency actions already taken under the policy.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 18, Plaintiffs moved for preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 12, Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to stay agency action and for preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 3: On Mar. 19, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion to stay agency action and for preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 28, Plaintiffs submitted a request to file a short, supplemental memorandum in support of their motion to stay agency action and for preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs\u2019 memorandum provides additional arguments to support their request for the court to order Defendants to temporarily reinstate prior passport policy to restore the status quo.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 4, Defendants filed a supplemental memorandum in which they requested any warranted relief be issued in the form of a targeted injunction at the particular agency action held to be invalid and limited to the plaintiffs whom the State Department is held to have taken unlawful action against. \nUpdate 6: On Apr. 18, Judge Julia Kobick granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. The order enjoins Secretary of State Marco Rubio against enforcing the passport policy against Plaintiffs and requires that the State Department permit changes to Plaintiffs\u2019 sex designations on their passports, but denies the request for a stay of the passport policy.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 25, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding Plaintiffs and details on continued harm to the plaintiffs since the initial filing of the lawsuit and on Apr. 30, filed a memorandum of support for the expanded class certification.\nUpdate 8: On June 13, Defendants filed a notice of appeal to the First Circuit as to Judge Julia Kobik\u2019s Apr. 18 Order of Preliminary Injunction. \nUpdate 9: On June 17, Judge Kobick granted the class certification and preliminary injunction.2025-06-17\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Passport policy targeting transgender people (Executive Order 14168)Schlacter v.

Edelblut (D.N.H.)\n\nCase No. 1:24-cv-00251Complaint; Amended Complaint (underlying case filed Aug. 16, 2024) 2025-02-12Overview: Two transgender teenage athletes in New Hampshire filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's Executive Order (\u201cEO\u201d) banning transgender women from female sports as unconstitutional, which expands upon a lawsuit they had previously brought under state law. The court had already ordered that the related state law not be enforced while that lawsuit was in progress. They have asked here that the court declare the EO unconstitutional and permanently stop its enforcement.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued Executive Order 14168, stating that there are only two sexes, male and female, and that they are determined by immutable biological factors at conception. On Feb. 5, the administration issued Executive Order 14201, directing the federal government to interpret and enforce Title IX under the sex definitions provided in Executive Order 14168, which would bar transgender women and girls from competing in women\u2019s sports. Plaintiffs, two transgender teenage athletes in New Hampshire, previously filed suit against the state, arguing a state law banning transgender women from competing in school sports was unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment and a violation of Title IX. On Sept. 10, 2024, the court ordered a preliminary injunction against the state law. On Feb. 12, following the Trump administration\u2019s executive order, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, seeking to add federal defendants to the suit. The amended complaint argues the executive order (1) unconstitutionally violates Fifth Amendment equal protection rights; (2) is an ultra vires action in conflict with Title IX; and (3) is an ultra vires action to withhold Congressionally appropriated funds. They seek a declaratory judgment that the executive order is unconstitutional and unlawful; and a permanent injunction enjoining its enforcement. 2025-02-12\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Ban on transgender athletes in women\u2019s sports (Executive Order 14168; Executive Order 14201) and policies on transgender studentsState of California v. Department of Justice (N.D.Cal)\n\nCase No. 3:25-cv-04863\nComplaint2025-06-09Overview:  The State of California filed a lawsuit challenging a demand by the Department of Justice (DOJ) that every California Local Education District certify that they will not implement a California law allowing transgender women and girls to compete in women\u2019s sports in school. The State asked the court to declare the demand unconstitutional and for preliminary and permanent injunctions to stop its enforcement.\nCase Summary: In 2013, California enacted California Education Code Section 221.5(f) which requires that \u201c[a] pupil shall be permitted to participate in sex-segregated school programs and activities, including athletic teams and competitions . . . irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil\u2019s records.\u201d and the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF), the statewide governing body for secondary school athletics, adopted this same requirement through CIF Bylaw 300.D \nOn Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued Executive Order (EO) 14168, stating that there are only two sexes, male and female, and that they are determined by immutable biological factors at conception. On Feb. 5, the administration issued EO 14201, directing the federal government to interpret and enforce Title IX under the sex definitions provided in EO 14168, which would bar transgender women and girls from competing in women\u2019s sports. EO 14201 further directs that \u201c[a]ll executive departments and agencies . . . shall review grants to educational programs and, where appropriate, rescind funding to programs that fail to comply with the policy established in this order.\u201d \nOn June 2, 2025, Defendant U.S. DOJ issued a letter (the \u201cCertification Demand Letter\u201d) to every Local Education Agency (LEA) in California, which asserts that CIF Bylaw 300.D is \u201cfacially\nunconstitutional\u201d as it would violate the Equal Protection rights of cisgender girls and demanding that all LEA\u2019s certify in writing by June 9, 2025 that they will not implement CIF Bylaw 300.D. \nPlaintiff sued, asserting that the Certification Demand Letter would require California to violate the Equal Protection Clause by preventing the state from protecting the rights of transgender students. The State further argues that Defendants have no statutory or regulatory authority to demand certification and threaten to withhold funding as this was not specifically authorized by Congress. California also asserts that the Certification Demand Letter violates the Spending Clause due to a lack of clear notice of a change in conditions of receiving funds and because Congress may not impose a spending condition that would induce a State to violate the Constitution, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act as agency action contrary to constitutional right and in excess of statutory right. \nCalifornia seeks a declaratory judgement that CIF Bylaw 300.D does not violate the Equal Protection Clause, that the demands in the Certification Demand Letter violate the Equal Protection Clause, that Defendants acted ultra vires by issuing the Certification Demand Letter, that California LEA\u2019s are obligated not to provide certification, and that the Certification Letter should be vacated. They also seek a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining Defendants from acting on the Certification Demand Letter.2025-06-09\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Immigration enforcement against places of worship and schools (Policy Memo)Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends, et al. v.

The coalition argues the policy violates constitutional rights and federal laws, and has asked the court to stop its implementation. The court partially granted their request by blocking any enforcement of the policy in or near any place of worship owned or used by the plaintiff organizations without a warrant, however DHS has appealed this order to the Fourth Circuit.\nCase Summary: On January 20, 2025 the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a directive rescinding the Biden Administration\u2019s guidelines for ICE and CBP enforcement actions that restricted agents from conducting immigration enforcement in or near \u201csensitive\u201d areas, such as places of worship, schools, and hospitals. Under the new policy guidance, immigration enforcement in such areas would only be subject to the enforcement officers\u2019 \u201ccommon sense.\u201d \nThe plaintiffs, a coalition of Quaker congregations, seek to enjoin enforcement of this policy change and request a court declaration that any government policy permitting immigration enforcement based solely on subjective common sense is an unconstitutional violation of the freedom of expressive association under the First Amendment. Their complaint also claims that the new policy violates the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 4, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO and preliminary injunction against implementation of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 24, the court granted in part a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the DHS 2025 directive in or near any place of worship owned or used by the plaintiff organizations without an administrative or judicial warrant; and instead requiring adherence to the 2021 guidelines.

United States Department of Homeland Security et al (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00403Complaint2025-02-11Overview: Over two dozen Christian and Jewish religious organizations sued the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), challenging a new policy allowing immigration enforcement in \"sensitive\" areas like places of worship. The organizations argue that the new policy violates the Constitution and federal laws, and have asked the court to block DHS from enforcing the new policy without a warrant or severe circumstances. The court denied these organizations\u2019 request to block the enforcement of the new policy, a decision which has since been appealed by the organizations.\nCase Summary: On January 20, 2025 the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a directive rescinding the Biden Administration\u2019s guidelines for ICE and CBP enforcement actions that restricted agents from conducting immigration enforcement in or near \u201csensitive\u201d areas, such as places of worship, schools, and hospitals. \nOver two dozen Christian and Jewish religious denominations and associations sued for a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting DHS from effectuating the directive. The complaint asserts that DHS\u2019s authorization of immigration enforcement action at plaintiffs\u2019 places of worship in the absence of exigent circumstances or a judicial warrant violates their rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and the First Amendment. In addition, the complaint alleges that DHS\u2019s manner of recission of the \u201csensitive locations policy\u201d violates legal constraints on agency action.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 21, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining Defendants from carrying out immigration enforcement activities at their places of worship absent exigent circumstances or a judicial warrant. \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 14, Defendants filed a memorandum in opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction, claiming that the plaintiffs lack standing, do not sufficiently claim irreparable injury, and that there is not a substantial burden on the plaintiffs\u2019 exercise of their religion.They also claim that the Government has a compelling interest in the uniform enforcement of immigration laws.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 24, Plaintiffs filed a reply to the Defendants\u2019 motion in opposition.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 11, Judge Friedrich denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, stating in the accompanying memorandum opinion that the Plaintiffs have not shown a substantial likelihood of standing.\nUpdate 5: On May 30, Plaintiffs appealed Judge Friedrich\u2019s order denying their preliminary injunction motion to the D.C.

Colo) \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00474Complaint2025-02-12Overview: Denver Public Schools challenged the Trump Administration\u2019s new policy, issued via the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d), which allows immigration enforcement in \"sensitive\" areas like schools. The schools argue that DHS failed to provide a reasoned explanation for the policy change and violated disclosure requirements under federal law. The schools have asked the court to temporarily stop enforcement of the policy while the lawsuit is in progress. \nCase Summary: On January 20, 2025 the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a directive rescinding the Biden Administration\u2019s guidelines for ICE and CBP enforcement actions that restricted agents from conducting immigration enforcement in or near \u201csensitive\u201d areas, such as places of worship, schools, and hospitals. \nDenver Public Schools filed a suit challenging the recission of the policy, alleging that DHS implemented this major policy change through internal memoranda that have never been publicly released, with the shift announced only through a press release. According to the complaint, the new policy allegedly replaces three decades of formal protections with vague guidance that agents should use \"common sense\" in deciding whether to conduct enforcement actions at sensitive locations. The Plaintiff argues that this reversal of a decades-old policy constitutes final agency action subject to review under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that DHS failed to meet the basic requirements for changing established policy \u2014 including the need to provide reasoned explanation for the change, consider reliance interests, and examine alternatives. The Plaintiff further alleges that DHS\u2019s failure to publish the policy memoranda violates FOIA disclosure requirements. The suit asks the court to enjoin and vacate the new policy and require the 2025 policy to be made public.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 12, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO and preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Executive Order.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 7, the court denied Plaintiff\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 16, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds of a claimed \u201carbitrary, capricious\u201d conduct, constituting a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, requesting enjoinment and the vacating of the DHS policy.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 29, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the Court lacks jurisdiction over this action, the Plaintiffs lack standing, and they failed to state a claim.2025-04-29\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Restricting Press FreedomThe Associated Press v. Budowich (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00532Complaint2025-02-21Overview: The Associated Press (\u201cAP\u201d) sued the Trump administration after being banned from White House press events for refusing to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. AP argues that this ban violates their constitutional rights, including their First Amendment right to free expression. AP asked the court to declare the ban unconstitutional and to reinstate their access to the White House immediately and at least for the duration of the lawsuit. The court initially denied their request for immediate reinstatement but accelerated the process for hearing both sides\u2019 arguments, and more recently decided in favor of the AP to stop the White House action at least for the duration of the lawsuit.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 11, 2025, White House officials banned AP journalists from entering areas like the Oval Office and Air Force One as members of the press pool unless the AP began referring to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. On Feb. 21, the AP filed suit, claiming that the ban (1) violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause on the alleged grounds that the ban removes the AP from spaces it has used \u201cfor over a century\u201d and was announced with no prior notice, no written notice, no opportunity to challenge before it took effect, and no formal opportunity to challenge since; and (2) violates the First Amendment on the alleged grounds that the ban is an attempt to compel the AP\u2019s speech and retaliation for the AP\u2019s exercise of its protected rights of expression. The Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that denying AP access is unconstitutional, and a court order that the White House rescind the policy.\nOn Feb. 21, 2025, the AP also filed a motion for a TRO and a motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 24, in a 2-page order, Judge Trevor N. McFadden denied the motion for a temporary restraining order but noted that the court had ordered expedited hearings for consideration of a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 3, Plaintiffs submitted an amended motion for a preliminary injunction, responding to Judge McFadden\u2019s requests for briefings on specific questions, and requesting that the court require Defendants to rescind the ban on AP\u2019s access to spaces open to the White House press pool.\nUpdate 3: Given the amended motion for a preliminary injunction, Judge McFadden ordered the Feb. 21 motion moot on Mar. 4. \nUpdate 4: On Mar. 11, the Defendants filed a response opposing the Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. They argue that media organizations do not have a Fifth Amendment liberty interest in special access to the President and that it is not a violation of the First Amendment for the President to grant special media access based on the nature of a journalist\u2019s prior coverage. \nUpdate 5: On Mar. 25, the Defendants filed a supplemental declaration from Taylor Budowich, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff and Cabinet Secretary. The declaration provides some detail on the process for selecting press pool members and explains the access provided to the Plaintiff.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 8, the court granted a preliminary injunction on First Amendment grounds.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 10, the Defendants submitted a notice of appeal to DC Circuit.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 16, the Associated Press submitted a motion to enforce the Preliminary Injunction. The government submitted its opposition the following day. On Apr. 18, following a hearing, Judge McFadden denied the motion to enforce. He reportedly said from the bench, \u201cI don\u2019t intend to micromanage the White House;\u201d \u201cI think they are entitled to a presumption of good faith in their actions;\u201d and that it was too soon to draw conclusions as to whether the government was in violation of his order.\nUpdate 9: On Jun. 6, a federal appeals court agreed to let the administration ban the Associated Press from the Oval Office, Air Force One, Mar-a-Lago, and \u201cother similar restricted presidential workspaces,\u201d while litigation proceeds. \nThe court kept the injunction in effect for events held in the East Room, which the court recognized as a designated public forum subject to First Amendment protections.2025-06-06\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Restricting Press FreedomLos Angeles Press Club v.

The Plaintiffs allege that at each protest, DHS officers targeted, assaulted, tear-gassed, pepper-sprayed and shot protesters and reporters exercising their right to assemble, with the goal of deterring people from reporting, observing, and protesting. The group asked the Court to grant injunctive relief and a temporary restraining order (TRO) to stop DHS from continuing to threaten or assault the press or use crowd control weaponry. The TRO has been denied.\nCase Summary: A group of reporters, legal observers and protesters in Southern California filed a new lawsuit alleging that Department of Homeland Security officers have targeted and assaulted protesters, reporters covering these events, and legal observers seeking to document the government\u2019s conduct. The group alleges this conduct violates the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments, is chilling the right to peacefully report, observe, and protest, and has needlessly caused violence. The group seeks injunctive relief. \nUpdate 1: On June 18, Plaintiffs filed an ex parte application for a Temporary Restraining Order and an Order to Show Cause regarding the preliminary injunction. The group sought a TRO that would enjoin Defendants from dispersing, threatening or assaulting the press or legal observers, as well as using several violent means of crowd control.\nUpdate 2: On June 20, the Court denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 ex parte application for a TRO on the grounds that the Plaintiffs have not established standing for injunctive relief and that the requested relief was too broad.2025-07-10\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Restricting Press FreedomMedia Matters for America v.

It alleges that the FTC\u2019s investigation was motivated by Media Matters\u2019 negative reporting on Elon Musk\u2019s platform, \u201cX\u201d , and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. \nCase Summary: On June 23, 2025, Media Matters, a nonprofit organization that monitors, analyzes, and corrects mis-information in the US media,  filed suit against the Federal Trade Commission and several of its commissioners alleging that recent investigatory actions by the FTC into Media Matters amount to unlawful retaliation in violation of the First Amendment. The complaint asserts that the FTC\u2019s inquiry is politically motivated and designed to chill protected speech in response to Media Matters\u2019 reporting on Elon Musk\u2019s platform, X (formerly Twitter).

On June 3, the Fourth Circuit vacated the dismissal and remanded the case to the District Court, directing them to investigate whether the CRSA continues to function as necessary to provide appropriate relief.\nCase Summary: In July 2020, the National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ) filed suit in the Eastern District of Virginia to challenge an employee policy that requires immigration judges to  obtain  permission  before  speaking  publicly on issues relating to immigration. The NAIJ argued that the policy violates the First and Fifth Amendment rights of its members. The District Court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding that the policy could only be challenged through the administrative procedures established by the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA). \n\nThe Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal, and on June 3, the Fourth Circuit vacated the dismissal and remanded the case to the district court. The Court held that although the CSRA\u2019s administrative scheme would normally be the appropriate venue for this case, the CSRA \u201crequires a strong and independent Merit Systems Protections Board (MSPB) and Special Counsel\u201d and stated that the principle that \u201cfunctioning and independent bodies would receive, review, and decide in the first instance challenges to adverse personnel actions affecting covered federal employees has recently been called into question.\u201d In particular, the panel noted that \u201cthe Special Counsel and several members of the MSPB have been terminated by the President and the Government has questioned the constitutionality  of  the  removal  protections  enshrined  in  the  CSRA.\u201d\n\nThe Court vacated the case and remanded so that the District Court can evaluate whether the CSRA continues to function as Congress intended in order to determine whether it would be appropriate to strip jurisdiction from the district court.2025-06-03\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Action Against Law Firms and Lawyers (Executive Order 14230 - Perkins Coie) (Executive Order 14246 - Jenner & Block) (Executive Order - WilmerHale) (Presidential Memorandum)Perkins Coie LLP v.

A federal judge held the order is unlawful.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 6, President Trump issued an executive order (EO) accusing the law firm Perkins Coie LLP of undermining democracy and maintaining illegal race-based hiring quotas. The executive order directs various agencies to impose sanctions against the firm, including: terminating the firm\u2019s government contracts; suspending employees\u2019 security clearances pending a national-security review; ordering a review of the firm\u2019s hiring practices by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; limiting employees\u2019 access to federal buildings; and directing agencies not to hire Perkins Coie employees. \nThe Plaintiff sued, alleging that the executive action is unconstitutional, violating separation of powers, the First Amendment\u2019s protections for freedom of speech and association, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, the Fifth and Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to counsel, and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. They seek a declaratory judgment that the order is unconstitutional and an immediate injunction stopping implementation of the order pending court review, followed by preliminary and permanent injunctions.\nThe Plaintiff also submitted a request for a temporary restraining order and a proposed order that enjoined only Sections 1 (Purpose), 3 (Contracting), and 5 (Personnel including access to Federal Government buildings) of the executive order. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 12, Judge Beryl Howell, ruling from the bench, granted Perkins Coie\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order to block Sections 1, 3, and 5 of the executive order. During the hearing, she reportedly noted that the Plaintiff had not requested the TRO apply to Section 2 (Security Clearances) and Section 4 (Racial Discrimination) of the executive order, although those sections are also part of the lawsuit. She followed hours later with a written order.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 21, the Defendant filed a motion to disqualify the judge. On Mar. 26, the court denied the motion.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 2, Perkins Coie filed a motion for summary judgment and requested the court to permanently block Defendants from enforcing the EO. Perkins Coie argues the Court should declare the EO unlawful for violating the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution, exceeding the President\u2019s constitutional authority under Article II, and violating the separation of powers. \nOn that same day, the DOJ filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, arguing that the EO directs the review of Perkins Coie to ensure that the Federal Government\u2019s dealings with the firm are consistent with national security and other public interests. Defendants also filed a motion to reconsider the scope of the TRO granted on Mar. 12, arguing it is overly broad because the United States is not a proper defendant.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 16, Perkins Coie filed its opposition to the DOJ\u2019s motion to dismiss, emphasizing the retaliatory nature of the EO. On that same day, the DOJ filed its opposition to Perkins Coie\u2019s motion for summary judgment, instead requesting the court grant its motion to dismiss.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 18, the DOJ replied to Perkins Coie\u2019s opposition to its motion to dismiss, asserting Perkins Coie\u2019s conduct is subject to reasonable scrutiny and that the court is not the proper recourse for Perkins Coie\u2019s concerns.\nOn that same day, Perkins Coie replied to the DOJ\u2019s opposition to its motion for summary judgment, emphasizing its view that the EO is \u201cblatantly unconstitutional\u201d and requesting the court grant its summary judgment motion on all claims.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 29, Perkins Coie amended its complaint to list all of the defendants and their addresses.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 30, the Fannie Mae defendants were voluntarily dismissed in a notice by Perkins Coie. On that same day, Perkins Coie filed a motion for summary judgment and the DOJ renewed its motion to dismiss and requested expedited judgment.\nUpdate 8: On May 2, Judge Howell held that the EO violates the law and is invalid. Specifically, Judge Howell held that the EO violates the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments and permanently enjoined the DOJ from implementing, enforcing, or using statements from the EO in any way. Judge Howell granted Perkins Coie\u2019s motion for summary judgment and declaratory relief and denied the DOJ\u2019s motion to dismiss. \nUpdate 9: The Department of Justice filed a notice of appeal today in response to Judge Howell\u2019s judgment and injunction blocking Executive Order 14230, which explicitly targeted law firm Perkins Coie. In her May 2 decision, Judge Howell ruled the Executive Order unconstitutional and condemned it as an \u201cunprecedented attack\u201d on the \u201cfoundational principles\u201d of the judicial system.2025-06-30\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Action Against Law Firms and Lawyers (Executive Order 14230 - Perkins Coie) (Executive Order 14246 - Jenner & Block) (Executive Order - WilmerHale) (Presidential Memorandum)Jenner & Block v.

The same day, a federal judge granted the law firm\u2019s request to temporarily block several sections of the EO. The federal court later held the order is unlawful.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 27, President Trump passed an executive order accusing the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP of engaging in activities that undermine justice and the interests of the United States. The executive order directs various agencies to impose sanctions against the firm, including: suspending employees\u2019 security clearances pending a national-interest review; terminating the firm\u2019s government contracts to the extent permitted by law; and limiting employees\u2019 access to federal buildings. The Plaintiff sued, alleging that the executive action is unconstitutional. Specifically, the Plaintiff alleges that the order: (i) violates the First Amendment\u2019s protections against retaliation for protected expression, prohibition against viewpoint discrimination, right to petition the government, and freedom of association; (ii) exceeds the President\u2019s authority and interferes with federal courts\u2019 Article III powers; (iii) violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process and Equal Protection clauses; (iv) violates the Fifth and Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to counsel; (v) violates Article I of the Constitution.

He denied a TRO for section 2 of the EO restricting security clearances. The court wrote that the DC Circuit \u201chas held that security clearance decisions are within the purview of the Executive Branch,\u201d and thus the Plaintiff did not have a likelihood of success on the merits on that specific issue.  \n\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 8, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.

Executive Office of the President (D.D.C.)\n\nCase no. 1:25-cv-01107Complaint2025-04-11Overview:  Susman Godfrey, a law firm, challenges the Apr. 9 Executive Order (EO) issued against it. The EO suspends the security clearances of Susman Godfrey employees, requires government contractors to disclose any business with Susman and threatens the termination of the government contracts, bars Susman employees from federal buildings, limits the engagement of government officials with Susman employees, and prohibits agencies from hiring Susman employees. Susman alleges that the EO violates the First and Fifth Amendments, the Spending Clause, and is outside the President\u2019s scope of authority. The district court decided the case in favor of the plaintiff.\n\nCase Summary: On Apr. 9, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) against Susman Godfrey, a Texas-based trial firm. The EO orders heads of executive agencies to suspend security clearances held by Susman employees. It also orders agencies to require government contractors to disclose any business with Susman and to review contracts with contractors that disclose doing so. It also requires agencies to terminate all contracts with Susman. Finally, the EO bars Susman employees from accessing federal buildings, limits the interactions of government personnel with Susman employees, and prohibits agencies from hiring Susman employees. Susman sued over 50 federal defendants to challenge the Order. Susman argues that it faces irreparable reputational and economic harm. \nSusman claims that the EO violates the First Amendment because it constitutes both government retaliation for the Firm\u2019s engagement in protected speech and viewpoint discrimination. The Firm also alleges the EO violates its First Amendment right to petition the government and freedom of association. Susman additionally claims that the conditions placed on government contracts are in violation of the Spending Clause. Susman also argues that the EO violates the Fifth Amendment in multiple ways. It violates the Due Process Clause because of the absence of procedural due process and because the EO is unconstitutionally vague; it violates the right to counsel; and it violates equal protection rights. Finally, Susman argues that the EO is an ultra vires action that exceeds the President\u2019s scope of authority as it violates the separation of powers. \nSusman requests the Court block the Defendants from implementing the EO and order them to cancel any guidance implementing the EO that has already been issued. \nUpdate 1: On Apr. 14, Susman filed a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order asking the court to block the enforcement of EO Sections 1 (Background), 3 (Contracting), and 5 (Personnel, including access to Federal Buildings). On Apr. 16, the court granted the temporary restraining order (TRO). On Apr. 16, this TRO was extended until final judgment is entered in the matter.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 23, Susman filed a motion for summary judgment and supporting memorandum in which it requested the court to permanently enjoin the Defendants\u2019 implementation of the EO and declare the Defendants\u2019 actions unlawful.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 30, Susman filed its opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, emphasizing their actions constitute a \u201cbrazen defiance of the separation of powers and rule of law.\u201d\nOn that same day, Defendants filed their opposition to Susman\u2019s motion for summary judgment, asserting the EO merely directs agencies to do their jobs and that Susman\u2019s claims regarding access to agency buildings are unripe because the related EO section asks agency heads to provide guidance on Susman employee access instead of outright limiting said access.\nUpdate 4: On May 5, Susman filed its reply memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment, and Defendants filed their reply to Susman\u2019s opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.\nUpdate 5: On May 12, Defendants filed their motion to dismiss Susman\u2019s amended complaint, for the same reasons contained in their previous motion to dismiss. On that same day, Susman filed a motion for summary judgment, requesting that the court declare the EO unlawful and enjoin Defendants from implementing or enforcing the EO, for the same reasons contained in their previous motion for summary judgment.\nUpdate 6: On June 27, Judge Loren Alikan granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment for 8 of the 10 Counts (the two exceptions were a Spending Clause Count and a separation-of-powers Count), and issued a permanent injunction.2025-06-27\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Action Against Law Firms and Lawyers (Executive Order 14230 - Perkins Coie) (Executive Order 14246 - Jenner & Block) (Executive Order - WilmerHale) (Presidential Memorandum)Doe et al v. EEOC (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01124Complaint2025-04-15Overview:  Plaintiffs, three law school students, have challenged the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) sending letters to 20 law firms, pursuant to President Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Order (EO) regarding the DEI-related hiring practices of law firms. These letters requested information about these law firms\u2019 hiring practices, including the personally identifiable information of lawyers employed with these firms and law students that have applied for positions at these firms. Plaintiffs allege that these investigations are outside of the authority of the EEOC and violate the Paperwork Reduction Act. They have asked the Court to order the EEOC to stop investigating law firms in excess of their authority and return and delete any information that has already been collected pursuant to the investigation of these firms.\nCase Summary:  On Mar. 6, 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order (EO) No. 14230 titled \u201cAddressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP.\u201d This EO directed the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to review the hiring practices of law firms for consistency with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. On Mar. 17, 2025, Acting Chair of the EEOC Andrea Lucas sent letters to 20 law firms asking about DEI-related employment practices, including requests for personally identifiable information of lawyers employed by these firms and law students who had applied for positions. Plaintiffs are three current law school students who applied to work at some of the law firm recipients of these letters. They allege that much of the information requested is sensitive or confidential, and that their privacy will be harmed if law firms provide that information to the EEOC. Plaintiffs claim that Defendants\u2019 sending these letters constitutes an ultra vires action that is outside of the EEOC\u2019s authority because 1) the EEOC has started this investigation without a charge being filed, 2) the investigation is being conducted publicly, and 3) the EEOC lacked relevant quorum when issuing these letters. Plaintiffs also claim that Defendants acted in violation of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Plaintiffs request that the Court declare that sending the letters was an ultra vires action, order Defendants to withdraw the Mar. 17 letters, enjoin them from conducting investigations of law firms that do not meet Title VII requirements, and order them to return any information already collected pursuant to the letters and delete that information from their databases. \nUpdate 1: On May 16, Plaintiffs amended their complaint to be a class action complaint for others similarly situated.\nUpdate 2: On June 26, Judge Reggie Walton permitted extensions of time for Defendants to respond to Plaintiffs\u2019 Amended Complaint and Motion for Summary Judgment. Additionally, Judge Walton denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification and did not otherwise stay the proceedings.2025-06-26\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Action Against Law Firms and Lawyers (Executive Order 14230 - Perkins Coie) (Executive Order 14246 - Jenner & Block) (Executive Order - WilmerHale) (Presidential Memorandum)Zaid v Executive Office of the President (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01365Complaint2025-05-05Overview:  Mark Zaid\u2019s limited access security clearance was rescinded by the Trump Administration after a Mar. 22, 2025 Memorandum ordering the revocation of several individuals\u2019 limited access security clearance. In 2019, Zaid, an attorney, represented a government whistleblower who had filed a complaint with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence which culminated in President Trump\u2019s first impeachment. Trump called out Zaid over his representation of the whistleblower during Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. On Feb. 4, 2025, Zaid filed a lawsuit on behalf of Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel who had investigated the Jan. 6, 2020 attack on the Capitol. On Mar. 20, 2025 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard posted on X that she would revoke Zaid\u2019s security clearance along with those of several others. Zaid filed a complaint against the Trump administration on May 5, 2025.\nCase summary: Mark Zaid\u2019s limited access security clearance was rescinded by the Trump Administration after a Mar. 22, 2025 Memorandum ordering the revocation of several individuals\u2019 limited access security clearances. Zaid alleges that the revocation of his limited security access was politically motivated and lacked any of the procedural due process afforded to security clearance holders or applicants whose security clearance is denied or revoked. Zaid, who is an attorney, asserts that the revocation of his security clearance prevents him from accessing classified material needed to represent current and prospective clients, hampering his ability to represent these clients before government agencies.2025-05-05\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Action Against Law Firms and Lawyers (Executive Order 14230 - Perkins Coie) (Executive Order 14246 - Jenner & Block) (Executive Order - WilmerHale) (Presidential Memorandum)American Bar Association v. U.S. Department of Justice (D.D.C.) \n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01263 Complaint2025-04-23Overview:  The American Bar Association (ABA) sued the Department of Justice (DOJ), Attorney General Pamela Bondi, and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche claiming that the Defendants unlawfully terminated grants to the ABA Commission on Domestic and Sexual Violence (ABA CDSV) in violation of the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\nCase Summary: The ABA has been receiving grants since 1995 through the DOJ Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) to support programs designed to increase access to justice for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. On April 9, 2025 Defendant Blanche issued a memorandum entitled \u201cEngagement with the American Bar Association\u201d (Blanche Memo) imposing limits on DOJ employees\u2019 engagement with the ABA and asserting that the DOJ can withhold funds from the ABA due to disagreements with ABA actions, including litigation against the Administration on issues \u201ccontrary to the federal government\u2019s policies.\u201d On April 10, DOJ terminated all of ABA\u2019s OVW grants, citing a change in \u201cagency priorities.\u201d \nOn April 23, the ABA filed suit, contending that this action was taken in retaliation against the ABA for taking positions that the current Administration disfavors. Plaintiffs allege that these actions violate the First Amendment as they are retaliation for protected activity and viewpoint discrimination, as well as constituting unconstitutional conditions on federal funding in violation of the First Amendment and the Spending Clause, and also violate Fifth Amendment equal protection and due process protections. They also argue that the grant terminations violate the APA as arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law. \nPlaintiffs seek a declaration that the termination of the ABA\u2019s CDSV grants is unlawful as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions against enforcing the terminations and requiring the disbursement of the grants.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 24, the Plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and accompanying memorandum citing irreparable harm.\nUpdate 2: On May 2, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and a memorandum in support of this motion and in opposition to the Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a TRO, claiming that the Court lacks jurisdiction and that the funding decision was within the legal discretion of the DOJ.\nUpdate 3: On May 7, the Plaintiff filed a reply to the opposition to the motion for a TRO and a reply to the motion to dismiss.\nUpdate 4: On May 9, Defendants filed a reply in support of the motion to dismiss.\nUpdate 5: On May 14, Judge Christopher Cooper granted a preliminary injunction on the plaintiff\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim.2025-05-14\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Action Against Law Firms and Lawyers (Executive Order 14230 - Perkins Coie) (Executive Order 14246 - Jenner & Block) (Executive Order - WilmerHale) (Presidential Memorandum)American Bar Association v. Trump (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01888Complaint2025-06-16Overview:  The American Bar Association filed a new lawsuit on June 16, 2025 alleging that the administration\u2019s \u201cLaw Firm Intimidation Policy\u201d is unlawful. The ABA argues that the policy, which they say is designed to intimidate and coerce law firms and lawyers from challenging or speaking out against the administration, violates the First Amendment and separation of powers.\nCase Summary: In March and April of 2025, President Trump signed a series of Executive Orders (EO\u2019s) specifically directed at five law firms that he stated had taken actions that he viewed as against the \u201cnational interest\u201d, including practices related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), employment of lawyers who were involved in or associated with investigations or prosecution of President Trump, and conduct or advocacy otherwise disfavoured by the Administration. The EO\u2019s (collectively, the \u201cLaw Firm Orders\u201d) imposed sanctions that included termination of security clearances for employees of those firms, a requirement that all government contractors disclose any business done with those law firms, termination of government contracts, limiting federal building and employee access, and the refusal to offer federal employment to employees of targeted law firms.\nThe EO\u2019s also direct the EEOC and the Attorney General to investigate these firms for violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. On March 17, 2025 the EEOC also sent letters to twenty other law firms requesting information about their DEI practices. On March 22, 2025, the White House issued a memorandum entitled \u201cPreventing Abuses of the Legal System and the Federal Court\u201d directing the Attorney General to \u201cseek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States\u201d. On May 9, 2025, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued a memorandum prohibiting the government, subject to limited exceptions, from hiring as private counsel any attorneys from any law firm that represents clients in \u201cactive litigation against Administration policies.\u201d\n\nThe American Bar Association (ABA), a non-partisan non-profit organisation and the nation\u2019s largest voluntary association of legal professionals, filed suit against the United States as well as federal departments and agencies that have been directed to implement these EO\u2019s, the heads of those departments and agencies, and federal agencies likely to implement these orders. The complaint alleges that the EO\u2019s, along with the various memoranda and public statements issued by the Administration constitute an unconstitutional policy (the \u201cLaw Firm Intimidation Policy\u201d or \u201cPolicy\u201d) that is designed to intimidate and coerce law firms and lawyers to refrain from challenging the President or his Administration in court, or from even speaking publicly in support of policies or causes that the President does not like.\nThe complaint asserts that the unlawful coercive effects of the Policy are evident in the fact that although four federal judges have ruled that the Law Firm Orders are unconstitutional, numerous firms made pre-emptive commitments to support Administration policies out of concern that they would be targeted (or in the case of Paul Weiss, to effect the revocation of the order against it).They claim that the Policy has successfully coerced much of the profession to forego constitutionally protected activity, including litigation against the Administration, and notes that none of the top 25 firms and less than ten of top 100 firms have been willing to file amicus briefs in support of the firms targeted by the Law Firm Orders.\nThe Plaintiff allege that both the ABA itself and its member attorneys have suffered harm because of the Policy, including not bringing various cases, finding it difficult to find co-counsel in cases (or in the case of the ABA, to find law firms to represent it in litigation adverse to the government), changes to case acceptance procedures at their firms, and the need to devote substantial resources to mitigate the impact of the orders or to prepare for the possibility of retaliation. They also assert that so long as there is a reasonable likelihood that the Administration will target any law firm which represents causes and clients the Administration dislikes with retaliatory sanctions, \u201cwide swaths of the legal profession\u2014including many members of the ABA\u2014will continue to be chilled in the exercise of their constitutional rights.\u201d \nThe ABA alleges that the Policy is a violation of the First Amendment due to 1) suppression of and threatened retaliation for protected activity (the provision of advocacy and advice); 2) viewpoint discrimination; 3) a violation of the constitutionally protected right to petition the government, since it causes members to refrain from bringing litigation in matters adverse to the federal government; 4) a violation of the right to free association and compelled disclosure, insofar as it requires government contractors to disclose any business they do with targeted law firms and threatens to unlawfully impose punishment based on protected association with others; and 5) overbreadth as unduly vague, since it has caused ABA members and their law firms to divert resources away from their ordinary business of representing clients in order to scrutinize and decline representations that may be perceived as falling afoul of vaguely and ambiguously described categories. They also assert that it is ultra vires as a violation of the Separation of Powers, as no act of Congress authorized the Policy or the Law Firm Orders or the negotiation for commitments of free legal work to avoid sanctions and suggest that these actions might actually be specifically prohibited by various Congressional statutes including anti-corruption statutes, the Merit System Protection Act, and others.\nPlaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief declaring that the various sanctions in the Law Firm Orders unconstitutional and enjoining the enforcement of any of them against any ABA member or ABA member\u2019s law firm or initiating attorney conduct and disciplinary proceedings, of any ABA member or ABA member\u2019s law firm based on the individual\u2019s law firm or organizational affiliation or based on the identity of their client representations.2025-06-16\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Election Law (Executive Order 14248)Democratic National Committee v.

They further allege that the EO will make it harder to register to vote, cast a ballot, and to administer fair elections, and that it violates individual privacy rights.\nPlaintiffs brought 11 counts, alleging (1) Ultra Vires presidential action; (2) Violation of the Separation of Powers with respect to various congressional and state authorities; (3) Administrative Procedure Act (APA) violations with respect to various statutes; and (4) APA violations with respect to various constitutional provisions.\nPlaintiffs requested that the court declare the relevant sections of the EO unlawful and preliminarily and permanently enjoin the various government departments from taking any action to implement the EO.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 3, this case was consolidated with League of Latin American Citizens v.

Mass.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-10810Complaint2025-04-03Overview: 19 States challenged six provisions of Executive Order 14248, titled \u201cPreserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections\u201d (EO). Plaintiffs argue that President Donald Trump lacks authority to impose the proposed changes to elections law, and requested the court declare these provisions unconstitutional and void, and to enjoin enforcement of these provisions. The district court has temporarily blocked the administration\u2019s action. \nCase Summary: On Mar. 25, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order (EO) titled \u201cPreserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections.\u201d Among its requirements, the EO directs the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship on voter registration forms and provides that the  Department of Homeland Security and Department of Government Efficiency shall review each state\u2019s voter registration lists. The EO also directs the Attorney General to take action against states that count absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day, and it conditions various federal funding on compliance with the EO.\nPlaintiffs are 19 States that allege the President lacks authority to make the proposed changes to election law, that the EO infringes on the authority of States and Congress to determine election law, and that the EO would impose significant burden on the States to begin immediately conforming to the proposed new policy changes. Plaintiffs challenged six provisions of the EO: (1) Section 2(a), which requires the EAC to require documentary proof of citizenship in its national mail voter registration form; (2) Section 2(d), which requires Federal voter registration departments or agencies to assess citizenship prior to providing a Federal voter registration form to enrollees of public assistance programs; (3) Section 3(d), which requires the Secretary of Defense to require documentary proof of citizenship in the Federal Post Card Application pursuant to the Uniformed and Overseas Citizen Voting Absentee Voting Act; (4) Section 4(a), which requires the EAC to freeze funds to States that do not implement these documentary requirements; (5) Section 7(a), which directs the Attorney General to enforce a new statutory interpretation to disallow counting of ballots received after Election Day; and (6) Section 7(b), which directs the EAC to condition funding to States based on adherence to this interpretation of Election Day.\nPlaintiffs allege that the President does not have authority to implement these changes to election law. Specifically, they argue that these provisions of the EO are unconstitutional under the Bicameralism, Presentment, Elections, and Electors Clauses (depending on the provisions), ultra vires, in violation of the National Voter Registration Act, violate Separation of Powers, and violate State sovereignty. \nPlaintiffs have requested the court declare the challenged provisions unconstitutional and void, and to preliminarily and permanently enjoin all Defendants except President Trump from implementing or enforcing the challenged provisions.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 23, Defendants moved to transfer the case to the District of Columbia and consolidate the case with three other cases challenging the same provisions of the EO. The supporting memorandum of law notes these three DDC cases include: (1) League of United Latin American Citizens v. Executive Office of the President; (2) Democratic National Committee v. Trump; and (3) League of Women Voters Education Fund v. Trump. In the alternative, Defendants moved to stay the case pending the resolution of the aforementioned cases.\nUpdate 2: On May 5, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction and a supporting memorandum of law. The motion seeks relief for five of the six challenged provisions of the EO, including sections 2(a), 2(d), 3(d), 7(a), and 7(b).Plaintiffs argue that these provisions violate constitutional separation of powers, unconstitutionally impose extra-statutory conditions on congressionally appropriated funding, and unlawfully invade State sovereignty.\nUpdate 3: On May 7, Plaintiffs filed a motion in opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to transfer and consolidate or in the alternative to stay, arguing that there is a strong presumption in favor of Plaintiffs\u2019 choice of forum, that the Plaintiff States have distinct interests and harms from the private plaintiffs in the DDC cases, and that they therefore face severe prejudice if not allowed to litigate on their own timeline.\nUpdate 4: On May 9, the Court denied the transfer, stating that  \u201cthe differences between the matters counsel against consolidation\u201d, that the interests of justice do not favor transfer, and that a stay is not warranted.\nUpdate 5: On June 13, Judge Casper issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from enforcing key parts of the administration\u2019s election Executive Order, which requires states to demand proof of citizenship for voter registration, imposes new requirements on public assistance agencies, and penalizes states for ballot receipt deadlines and ballot curing practices. The court found that the coalition of states suing the government showed a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d that their citizens would be disenfranchised.2025-06-13\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Election Law (Executive Order 14248)State of Washington v.

Plaintiffs argue that President Donald Trump lacks authority to impose the proposed changes to elections law. Plaintiffs have requested the court declare these EO provisions unconstitutional and void, and to prevent the implementation and enforcement of these provisions.\nCase Summary: On Mar. 25, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order (EO) titled \u201cPreserving and Protecting the Integrity of American Elections.\u201d Among its requirements, the EO directs the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship on voter registration forms and provides that the  Department of Homeland Security and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) shall review each state\u2019s voter registration lists. The EO also directs the Attorney General to take action against states that count absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day, and it conditions various federal funding on compliance with the EO. \nPlaintiffs are the State of Washington and the State of Oregon. They are challenging ten provisions of the EO: (1) Section 2(a), which directs the EAC to require documentary proof of citizenship in its national mail voter registration form; (2) Section 2(b)(iii), which directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and DOGE to review each state\u2019s public voter registration list against federal immigration databases; (3) Section 2(d), which requires Federal voter registration departments or agencies to assess citizenship prior to providing a voter registration form to enrollees of public assistance programs; (4) Section 2(e)(ii), which directs the U.S. Attorney General to enforce federal election laws by using state-issued identification records and driver\u2019s license databases; (5) Section 3(d), which requires the Secretary of Defense to require documentary proof of citizenship for overseas voting; (6) Section 4(a), which directs the EAC to freeze funds to States that do not implement these documentary requirements; (7) Section 4(b), which sets guidelines for voting systems and directs the EAC to review and re-certify voting systems; (8) Section 4(d), which directs DHS and FEMA to consider withholding federal funding based on states\u2019 compliance with the voting system guidelines; (9) Section 5(b), which directs the the U.S. Attorney General to enforce Federal election integrity laws in the states and potentially withhold federal funding to states based on compliance; and (10) Section 7, which directs the Attorney General to take enforcement actions against any states found not in compliance with the EO and the EAC to condition federal funding to states based on their compliance. Plaintiffs allege that the challenged provisions violate the Elections Clause of the Constitution, the Tenth Amendment (powers reserved to the states), the constitutional right to vote, ultra vires and separation of powers principles, the Take Care Clause of the Constitution, and the National Voter Registration Act.

Trump (D.D.C.) \n\nCase No. (1:25-cv-01161)  Complaint2025-04-16Overview:  A group of individuals whose federal death sentences were commuted by President Biden challenge Donald Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 Executive Order (EO), directing the Attorney General to evaluate their imprisonment conditions for consistency with the \u201cmonstrosity\u201d of their crimes and the threats they pose, and the subsequent Attorney General memo (Bondi Memo) implementing the EO by incarcerating the individuals indefinitely at the only federal supermax prison. The individuals request that the Court enjoin implementation of the EO and the Bondi Memo, ordering appropriate redesignation based on initial designation by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).\nCase Summary: The plaintiffs, a group of individuals whose federal death sentences were commuted by President Biden, filed a complaint against President Trump, Attorney General Bondi, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), and other DOJ and BOP employees in their official capacity. The plaintiffs challenge Executive Order 14164, issued by President Trump, which directed the Attorney General to ensure their imprisonment in conditions reflecting the severity of their crimes. The Bondi Memo implemented this order, mandating their indefinite incarceration at ADX Florence, the only federal supermax prison. Plaintiffs allege that the redesignation process was a sham, denying them procedural due process and equal protection. They claim the conditions at ADX Florence constitute cruel and unusual punishment and deliberate indifference to their medical and mental health needs. Additionally, they argue that the redesignation directive is a bill of attainder and violates the Ex Post Facto Clause by retroactively increasing the severity of their punishment. The plaintiffs assert that these actions interfere with the clemency power of President Biden's commutation orders. They also contend that the defendants' actions exceeded statutory authority and were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to overturn EO 14164 and the Bondi Memo, ordering appropriate redesignation based on initial BOP decisions. The plaintiffs also request costs and attorneys' fees for the legal proceedings. \nUpdate 1: On May 2, Defendants filed a motion opposing Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 2: On May 12, Plaintiffs filed a reply memorandum in further support for their motion for a preliminary injunction, claiming that the Defendants stopped the lawful process to impose an extra-judicial punishment. Plaintiffs claim that they are likely to prevail on the merits, they will suffer irreparable harm if the Court does not intervene, and the balance of equities and public interest weighs heavily in their favor.\nUpdate 3: On May 27, Judge Timothy Kelly denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction  Judge Kelly\u2019s opinion noted Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, because they have not exhausted all available administrative remedies.2025-05-27\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Labor\u2019s Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) ending international cooperative agreements on workers\u2019 rightsAmerican Center for International Labor Solidarity v.

These nonprofit organizations have had to lay off employees and cease ongoing projects as a result of the termination because the agreements provided funding. The organizations challenge DOL\u2019s termination of the agreements as actions exceeding its authority and in violation of several provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).\nCase Summary: As part of the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s (DOGE) efforts to cut spending programs, the Department of Labor (DOL) has terminated all of the Bureau of International Labor Affairs\u2019 (ILAB) external grantmaking and agreements for technical assistance projects. Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations whose funding for programs to combat child and forced labor internationally was eliminated because of this termination. These organizations allege the termination is an ultra vires action that is contrary to several laws\u2013including the Appropriations Acts, Impoundment Control Act, and Anti-Deficiency Act-in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They also allege the termination is an arbitrary and capricious action under the APA, and request the court declare the mass termination of ILAB\u2019s agreements as unlawful and order the reinstatement of the ILAB cooperative agreements.\nUpdate 1: On May 5, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.2025-05-05\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: AccessibilityNational Association of the Deaf v.

The National Association of the Deaf and two of its members are challenging the Trump Administration\u2019s decision, arguing that it deprives them of the ability to meaningfully participate in American society. Plaintiffs allege the Administration is violating the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the First and Fifth Amendments. \nCase Summary: In January 2025, the Trump administration stopped providing ASL interpreters at public press briefings and other similar events. The federal government had provided ASL interpretation for all coronavirus press briefings following a court order in October 2020 and began voluntarily providing interpretation services at all press briefings by key administration officials in January 2021.   \nThe National Association of the Deaf (NAD), a civil rights organization, and two members of NAD are suing President Trump, Susan Wiles, the White House Chief of Staff, Karoline Leavitt, the Press Secretary to the President, and a number of offices within the White House to challenge the decision to stop providing ASL interpretation. Plaintiffs argue that without such services, deaf and hard of hearing individuals are unable to meaningfully access federal government programs and services or participate in American society. \nPlaintiffs claim that Defendants are violating the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits executive agencies from discriminating against individuals with disabilities when conducting any program or activity. Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants are violating the First Amendment, arguing that freedom of speech includes the right to receive information and that this deprivation impinges on their ability to petition the government. Plaintiffs further argue that the Fifth Amendment is violated because Plaintiffs are being denied equal protection under the law by being treated differently and because the Plaintiffs\u2019 fundamental rights under the First Amendment are being impinged upon.\nPlaintiffs seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief requiring Defendants to provide ASL interpreters at press briefings and other similar events. They also seek a court declaration that Defendants are violating the Rehabilitation Act and the First and Fifth Amendments.2025-05-28\n\n\nCivil Liberties and Civil RightsExecutive Action: Criminal Arrests and ProsecutionsBaraka v.

The organizations are asking the judge to declare both EOs unconstitutional and unlawful, and to stop enforcement of the EOs immediately and at least for the duration of the lawsuit. The judge has partially granted the organization\u2019s request by stopping enforcement of the EOs while the lawsuit is pending. The Trump administration has appealed the judge\u2019s decision to a higher court.  \nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order to \u201c[defend] women from gender ideology extremism and [restore] biological truth to the federal government.\u201d That same day, the President issued an executive order directing the OMB Director, assisted by the Attorney General and OPM, to terminate DEI programs, offices and positions, and \u201cequity-related\u201d grants and contracts.

They argue the second order unconstitutionally violates 5th Amendment due process for vagueness; the 1st Amendment\u2019s free speech clause; and the separation of powers. They seek declaratory judgments that both orders are unlawful and unconstitutional, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against both.\nUpdate 1: On Feb. 13, Plaintiffs moved for a TRO and preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Executive Orders.\nUpdate 2: On Feb. 18, Defendants filed a response against Plaintiffs' motion for a TRO and preliminary injunction, arguing, inter alia, that two of four Plaintiffs lack standing and that Plaintiffs' claims fail on merits.

Abelson issued a memorandum opinion and granted the preliminary injunction in large part, enjoining implementation of the Termination Provision of Executive Order 14151 and of the Certification and Enforcement Threat Provisions of Executive Order 14173. The court stated that \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 irreparable harms include widespread chilling of unquestionably protected speech.\" The court also denied the preliminary injunction in part, allowing the Attorney General to prepare the report pursuant to Executive Order 14173 and to engage in an investigation.\nUpdate 4: On Feb. 24, the Defendant submitted a notice of appeal to the Fourth Circuit.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 3, Judge Abelson denied the Defendants' motion to stay the injunction pending an appeal.\nUpdate 6: On Mar. 10, Judge Abelson granted Plaintiff\u2019s motion to clarify the scope of the injunction, such that it applies not only to \u201cpersons in active concert or participation with defendants,\u201d but to all federal executive branch agencies.\nUpdate 7: On Mar. 14, the Fourth Circuit granted the government\u2019s petition for a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal.\nUpdate 8: On Mar. 21, Plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the preliminary injunction granted by Judge Abelson on Feb. 21 in light of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s grant of stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal. Plaintiffs seek to vacate so that they can instead seek additional relief that takes into account new factual developments and also save judicial resources. \nUpdate 9: On Apr. 1, Defendants filed a motion opposing Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to vacate the preliminary injunction, asserting that the district court lacks the jurisdiction to do so after a notice of appeal has been filed.\nUpdate 10: On Apr. 2, Plaintiffs filed a reply in further support of their motion to vacate the preliminary injunction order and requested the Court grant this motion as soon as possible. \nUpdate 11: On May 1, 2025, the Court denied Plaintiffs\u2019 request to vacate the preliminary injunction order. \nUpdate 12: On May 7, the Plaintiff Restaurant Opportunities Center (\u201cROC\u201d) voluntarily dismissed without prejudice its claims in full against all Defendants.2025-05-07\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and AccessibilityExecutive Action: Ban on DEIA initiatives in the executive branch and by contractors and grantees (Executive Order 14168; Executive Order 14151; Executive Order 14173)Doe 1 v.

The officers argued that the ODNI terminated them without sufficient cause, in violation of the agency\u2019s legal obligations and their constitutional rights, and asked the court to immediately block ODNI\u2019s actions. A federal court has permitted ODNI to proceed but has extended the officers\u2019 deadline to resign voluntarily in return for additional time on paid leave.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order directing the OMB Director, assisted by the Attorney General and OPM, to terminate DEI programs, offices and positions, and \u201cequity-related\u201d grants and contracts. \nPlaintiffs are U.S. intelligence officers who were assigned to diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) initiatives at ODNI and CIA. The complaint alleges that Defendants placed Plaintiffs on administrative leave \u201capparently only because of [Plaintiffs\u2019] temporary assignments to personnel functions involving DEIA.\u201d Plaintiffs bring several causes of action. First, they claim that Defendants violated the Administrative Leave Act by placing Plaintiffs on leave for more than ten work days, despite the fact that no worker misconduct had been alleged. Second, Plaintiffs maintain that Defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act, because Plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cimminent termination\u201d is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with [Intelligence Community] regulations, and unsupported by any evidentiary record whatsoever.\u201d Third, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated the First and Fifth Amendments by firing Plaintiffs on the basis of \u201ctheir assumed beliefs about a domestic political issue [DEIA]\u201d and causing them to lose \u201ctheir property interest in their employment without due process of law.\u201d\nThe plaintiffs seek injunctive relief.

Plaintiffs are seeking a ruling to block their placement on administrative leave, as well as a ruling that the OEA is not a DEIA office.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order directing the OMB Director, assisted by the Attorney General and OPM, to terminate DEIA programs, offices and positions, and \u201cequity-related\u201d grants and contracts.

Plaintiffs are career civil employees who were placed on administrative leave and terminated from access to government systems on Jan. 22. Plaintiffs allege that the implementation of the EO violates the First Amendment because they were targeted because of their assumed beliefs about a domestic political issue (DEIA) which was unrelated to their work at VBA. They also allege that their termination violates the Administrative Procedure Act and the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

The organizations argue that the EOs violate constitutional rights, including free speech and due process. The organizations are asking the court to declare the EOs unlawful and to permanently block the EOs from being enforced.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, the Trump administration issued an executive order directing the OMB Director, assisted by the Attorney General and OPM, to terminate DEI programs, offices and positions, and \u201cequity-related\u201d grants and contracts. On Jan. 21, the administration issued another executive order revoking an Equal Employment Opportunity executive order applying to contractors, in place since 1965; requiring federal grant recipients and contractors to certify that they do not operate DEI programs that violate anti-discrimination laws; and requiring each executive agency to identify up to nine corporations or nonprofit entities or associations to target with civil investigations to deter DEI programs. Plaintiffs, non-profits that receive federal funding for programs designed to serve vulnerable populations, allege that the executive orders violate the First Amendment\u2019s protections for freedom of speech, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection and Due Process guarantees, and the Administrative Procedure Act.

Plaintiffs\u2019 response highlighted their limited access to information on the matter, stating that the limited publicly available information does not necessitate Judge Kelly\u2019s recusal. Defendants\u2019 response noted that their respective agencies have no awards, grants, or contracts with DDOT. Consequently, defendants do not believe recusal is required at this time.\nUpdate 4: On May 2, Judge Kelly denied Plaintiffs\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction, stating that Plaintiffs were not able to show that they were likely to succeed on any of their claims.2025-05-02\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and AccessibilityExecutive Action: Ban on DEIA initiatives in the executive branch and by contractors and grantees (Executive Order 14168; Executive Order 14151; Executive Order 14173)San Francisco AIDS Foundation et al v.

The order was entered on Apr. 15.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 18, Plaintiff requested the modification of the preliminary injunction order issued on Apr. 14. The order only modified one of the Plaintiff's federal grants, and Plaintiff requested that the order be expanded to enjoin the enforcement of the termination provision as to all five of the Plaintiff's federally funded grants.\nUpdate 9: On Apr. 25, the Government filed an opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s requested preliminary injunction order modification.\nUpdate 10: On May 1, the Plaintiff filed a reply in support of its motion to modify the preliminary injunction, emphasizing that Defendants\u2019 opposition does not dispute the plain language of the statutes and appropriations reports that demonstrate the grants at issue are intentionally funded by Congressional action.\nUpdate 11: On May 7, Judge Kennelly denied Plaintiff's motion to modify the preliminary injunction order, finding there was no manifest error of law warranting the modification.\nUpdate 12: On June 27, the Government filed a motion to stay discovery until the court considered the motion to dismiss, citing the Supreme Court\u2019s June 2025 decision in Nuclear Regulatory Commission v. Texas and the DC Court of Appeal\u2019s June 2025 opinion for In re U.S. Department of Government Efficiency Service.\nUpdate 13: On July 3, the Government appealed Judge Kennelly\u2019s Apr. 14 preliminary injunction order to the Seventh Circuit.2025-07-03\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and AccessibilityExecutive Action: Ban on DEIA initiatives in the executive branch and by contractors and grantees (Executive Order 14168; Executive Order 14151; Executive Order 14173)American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education v.

Md.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00702-JRR\n\nFourth Circuit Case No. ca5-2025-01281Complaint2025-03-03Overview: Three organizations who receive federal funding for teaching programs have sued the U.S. Department of Education (\u201cDOE\u201d), President Donald Trump, and the Acting Secretary of Education alleging two of Trump\u2019s Executive Orders (\u201cEO\u201d) requiring an end to federal funds going toward \u201cgender ideology extremism\u201d and \u201cDEI programs\u201d are unlawful. The organizations argue that the EOs were issued without the proper procedures, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act and that the EOs violate constitutional rights, specifically the right to due process. The organizations asked the judge to permanently or at least temporarily block enforcement of the EOs. The judge temporarily blocked the DOE from terminating certain grant programs on March 17 and defendants have appealed.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order to \u201c[defend] women from gender ideology extremism and [restore] biological truth to the federal government.\u201d That same day, the President issued an executive order directing the OMB Director, assisted by the Attorney General and OPM, to terminate DEI programs, offices and positions, and \u201cequity-related\u201d grants and contracts. On Jan. 21, the administration issued a third executive order revoking an Equal Employment Opportunity executive order in place since 1965; requiring federal grant recipients and contractors to certify that they do not operate DEI programs that violate anti-discrimination laws; and requiring each executive agency to identify up to nine corporations or nonprofit entities or associations to target with civil investigations to deter DEI programs. \nPlaintiffs are organizations whose members include hundreds of teacher preparation programs. Those programs receive grants through the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Teacher Quality Partnership Program (TQP), Supporting Effective Educator Development Program (SEED), and Teacher and School Leader Incentive Program (TSL). Plaintiffs assert that, pursuant to the President\u2019s Executive Order 14151 which halted DEI initiatives, the Department of Education summarily terminated many of the TQP, SEED, and TSL grants without proper procedure. Specifically, the lawsuit alleges that EO 14151 is unconstitutionally vague and that the termination of the grants constitutes an arbitrary and capricious decision in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief and an injunction ordering reinstatement of grant funds.\nThey also submitted a motion for a temporary restraining order. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 17, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction as to the Plaintiffs\u2019 APA claim.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 21, Defendants submitted a notice of appeal on the partial grant of the motion for preliminary injunction to the Fourth Circuit.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 25, Defendants filed a time sensitive motion for stay pending appeal with the Fourth Circuit.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 31, the Plaintiffs filed a motion to place the case in abeyance, stating that the disposition of another case pending before the Supreme Court will inform any future briefing in this litigation. The Plaintiffs asked the Court to suspend the briefing schedule and deadline to respond to the Defendants\u2019 motion to stay pending appeal until the Supreme Court weighs in on the related case.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 1, the Fourth Circuit denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to place the case in abeyance.\nThe next day, Plaintiffs filed their opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to stay pending appeal, arguing that Defendants are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their appeal.\nUpdate 6: On April 4, Defendants filed a reply in support of their motion to stay pending appeal.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 10, the Fourth Circuit granted the government\u2019s motion to stay the preliminary injunction upon consideration of the parties\u2019 submissions and the Supreme Court's recent order granting a stay pending appeal in Department of Education, et al. v. California, et al.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 27, Plaintiffs filed a motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction and a supporting memorandum of law in which they requested an indicative ruling because the case is currently on interlocutory appeal to the Fourth Circuit.\nUpdate 9: On May 6, the Court denied the Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 60(b) motion to dissolve preliminary injunction and request for indicative ruling under rule 62.1, stating that the Court struggles to see a substantive or procedural advantage if the Court were to dissolve the PI.2025-05-06\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and AccessibilityExecutive Action: Ban on DEIA initiatives in the executive branch and by contractors and grantees (Executive Order 14168; Executive Order 14151; Executive Order 14173)Rhode Island Latino Arts v.

The organizations are asking the judge to permanently block enforcement of the EO or at least temporarily while the case proceeds.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order to \u201c[defend] women from gender ideology extremism and [restore] biological truth to the federal government.\u201d That same day, the President issued an executive order directing the OMB Director, assisted by the Attorney General and OPM, to terminate DEI programs, offices and positions, and \u201cequity-related\u201d grants and contracts. On Jan. 21, the administration issued a third executive order revoking an Equal Employment Opportunity executive order in place since 1965; requiring federal grant recipients and contractors to certify that they do not operate DEI programs that violate anti-discrimination laws; and requiring each executive agency to identify up to nine corporations or nonprofit entities or associations to target with civil investigations to deter DEI programs. \n\nPlaintiffs are arts nonprofit corporations that have received funding from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). Pursuant to the Jan. 20 \u201cgender ideology\u201d EO, the NEA now requires all grant applicants to certify their understanding that \u201cfederal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology.\u201d Plaintiffs, who seek to \u201caffirm transgender and nonbinary identities and experiences in the projects for which they seek funding,\u201d allege that such projects now appear to be ineligible for NEA funding, and the vagueness of the new NEA policy \u201crequires [Plaintiffs] to guess as to what if anything they can create, produce, or promote that addresses themes of gender.\u201d The Plaintiffs claim that the NEA\u2019s \u201cgender ideology\u201d prohibition exceeds statutory authority under the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965 and is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the prohibition violates the First and Fifth Amendments by imposing vague and viewpoint-based restrictions on artistic speech. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief stopping the government from implementing the EO,, and they request a preliminary injunction, expedited hearing, and/or a temporary restraining order in light of a Mar. 24 deadline for NEA applications. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 21, the Defendants filed a response in opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s motion for preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 25, the Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 3, the court denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motions for a preliminary injunction, temporary restraining order, and expedited hearing. The Court noted that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, for now, are moot because NEA rescinded its implementation of the EO pending further administrative review. The Court cautioned that Plaintiffs may be able to return and request relief depending on the outcome of the administrative review.\nUpdate 4: On May 12, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which included updates on the changes to NEA policy that took place following the commencement of the lawsuit.2025-05-12\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and AccessibilityExecutive Action: Ban on DEIA initiatives in the executive branch and by contractors and grantees (Executive Order 14168; Executive Order 14151; Executive Order 14173)State of California v.

This case was voluntarily dismissed on Apr. 14.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order No. 14151 directing the government to terminate DEI programs, offices and positions, and \u201cequity-related\u201d grants and contracts. On Jan. 21, Trump issued Executive Order No. 14173 requiring federal grant recipients and contractors to certify that they do not operate DEI programs that violate anti-discrimination laws.The Plaintiff, a municipality, applied for and received a three year grant from the Defendant, Americorps, to fund volunteer programs. In compliance with Americorps\u2019 rules, the grant application included statements on the Plaintiff\u2019s plans to advance DEIA. Following the issuance of the two Executive Order (EOs) noted above, the Defendant notified the Plaintiff that it risked losing its funding if it failed to change the language of its grant or attest to not promoting DEI.

The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) issued two memoranda on Feb. 5 requiring all DoDEA schools to review their libraries and remove books related to gender ideology or \u201cdiscriminatory equity ideology topics\u201d, and to cease using curricular materials potentially related to these topics. School administrators in DoD schools throughout the world subsequently removed a wide range of books from libraries and made curricular changes including banning specific lessons, educational programming and cultural events based on content purportedly referencing race and gender ideologies. \nTwelve children who are minor dependents of active-duty servicemembers and attend K-12 DoDEA schools both in the US and abroad filed suit against DoDEA, its Director and the Secretary of Defense on Apr. 15, asserting that they are experiencing irreparable harms stemming from their reduced access to books, curricula, and educational information about race and gender in DoDEA schools and that these actions are a violation of their First Amendment right to receive information. They seek a declaratory judgment that their constitutional rights have been violated, reinstatement of the removed books and curricula, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against any enforcement of steps taken to implement the EOs.\nUpdate 1: On May 7, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and supporting memorandum.2025-05-07\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and AccessibilityExecutive Action: Ban on DEIA initiatives in the executive branch and by contractors and grantees (Executive Order 14168; Executive Order 14151; Executive Order 14173)King County v.

Wa.)\n\nCase No. 2:25-cv-00814Complaint2025-05-02Overview:  Eight cities and counties filed suit against the Trump administration to block the unilateral imposition of funding conditions (the \u201cConditions\u201d) to homelessness assistance and mass transit grants previously approved by Congress. The new Conditions included the prohibition of DEI initiatives, facilitation of federal immigration law enforcement, verification of immigration status in service provision, and prohibition on the promotion of \u201cgender ideology\u201d or \u201celective abortion.\u201d The Plaintiffs contend that the imposition of the Conditions violates numerous constitutional rights, including the Fifth and Tenth Amendments, the Spending Clause, and separation of powers, as well as the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and asks the Court to declare them unlawful and enjoin their imposition and enforcement. The court granted a temporary block to the plaintiffs to prevent Defendant from enforcing the grant conditions. Defendants have appealed this block to the Ninth Circuit.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 20, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14168, titled \u201cDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\u201d which directed federal agencies to \u201ctake all necessary steps, as permitted by law, to end the Federal funding of gender ideology\u201d and \u201cassess grant conditions and grantee preferences\u201d to \u201censure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.\u201d  On Jan. 21, Trump issued EO 14173, titled  \u201cEnding Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,\u201d which instructed federal agencies to include \u201cin every contract or grant award\u201d a term that the contractor or grant recipient \u201ccertify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI\u201d that would violate federal antidiscrimination laws. On Jan. 24, Trump issued EO 14182, titled \u201cEnforcing the Hyde Amendment,\u201d which directed federal agencies to \u201cend the forced use of Federal taxpayer dollars to fund or promote elective abortion.\u201d On Feb. 19, Trump issued EO 14218, titled \u201cEnding Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders,\u201d which directed federal agencies to ensure \u201cthat Federal payments to States and localities do not, by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called \u2018sanctuary\u2019 policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.\u201d \nAfter these EO\u2019s were issued, counties and municipalities received grant agreements from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) which included provisions reflecting these executive orders as conditions to continue receiving already apportioned funding. Grants affected included funds designed to provide housing and related services for people exiting homelessness, including healthcare, transportation and job services, which were previously authorized by Congress as part of HUD\u2019s Continuum of Care program.Plaintiff King County also received the same Conditions in an updated master agreement with the  Federal Transit Authority (FTA) for certain federal grants. The Conditions imposed require that Plaintiffs comply with the Trump administrations\u2019 interpretation of non-discrimination law as barring any and all DEI programs, facilitate the administration\u2019s immigration policies, including the use of a federally mandated verification system to prevent illegal immigrants from receiving benefits, and not fund or promote gender ideology or elective abortions.\nPlaintiff counties and cities jointly filed a complaint against HUD, the FTA, and the FTA\u2019s parent agency, the Department of Transportation (DOT) on May 7, contending that the new Conditions are unlawful since only Congress has the power to attach conditions to federal grants, and therefore the Conditions contravene separation of powers principles. They also allege that the Conditions are unconstitutionally vague, contrary to existing non-discrimination statutes, and in violation of the Spending Clause, the Fifth and Tenth Amendments, and the APA, as arbitrary and capricious, contrary to regulations (including notice-and comment requirements) and the Constitution, and in excess of statutory authority. Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the conditions are unlawful and a preliminary and permanent injunction against Defendants enforcing the Conditions.\nUpdate 1: On May 5, the Plaintiffs filed for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), alleging that the Conditions require them to make a \u201cHobson\u2019s choice between agreeing to abandon their values, laws and policies or else put hundreds of millions of grant dollars in jeopardy in an extremely limited time frame\u201d. They argue that forfeiting the funding would cut off critical programs and services and significantly impact their budgets.\nUpdate 2: On May 6, Defendants filed their opposition to the TRO on the grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction, which they allege that under the Tucker Act should lie with the Court of Federal Claims.\nUpdate 3: On May 7, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for a TRO, arguing that the Court does have jurisdiction and reasserting the above claims.\nUpdate 4: On May 7, Judge Barbara J. Rothstein granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a TRO, noting that the Court does have jurisdiction since the claim is based on statutory and constitutional rights and the relief sought would not be available in the Court of Federal Claims; that the Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits.\nUpdate 5: On May 14, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction motion, reiterating their belief that the court does not have jurisdiction over the matter.\nUpdate 6: On June 4, Judge Rothstein granted Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 7: On June 9, Defendants appealed Judge Rothstein\u2019s preliminary injunction order to the Ninth Circuit.2025-06-09\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and AccessibilityExecutive Action: Ban on DEIA initiatives in the executive branch and by contractors and grantees (Executive Order 14168; Executive Order 14151; Executive Order 14173)Southern Education Foundation v.

The Plaintiff alleges that the termination of their grant violates constitutional rights and the Administrative Procedure Act and asked the court to declare the termination unlawful and unconstitutional, and to immediately and permanently block the implementation and enforcement of the funding termination. On May 21, the court preliminarily blocked the government\u2019s action and ordered the grant award to EAC-South reinstated.\nCase Summary: Plaintiff Southern Education Foundation, Inc (SEF) is a nonprofit organization that has been committed to advancing equitable education policies and practices for public school students across the southern United States for over 150 years. It was selected by the DoE to operate the Equity Assistance Center for the southern region (EAC-South), one of several regional assistance centers authorized by Congress under Title IV to assist with the desegregation of public schools. SEF was provided a five-year grant to operate the EAC in 2022.\n\nOn January 20, President Trump signed Executive Order  (EO) 14151, titled \u201cEnding Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing\u201d  which instructed federal agencies to \u201ccoordinate the termination of all discriminatory programs, including illegal DEI and \u2018diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility\u2019 (DEIA) mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities in the Federal Government.\u201d On Jan. 21, Trump issued EO 14173 \u201cEnding Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity\u201d which reiterated the illegality of DEI programs.\n\nFollowing the release of these EOs, on Feb. 13 the DoE issued a letter (\u201cTermination Letter\u201d) terminating EAC-South\u2019s ability to draw down funds previously obligated to SEF and issued a Grant Award Notification (GAN) terminating SEF\u2019s grant and project. The Termination Letter asserted that the funding that supported the EAC-South promoted initiatives that were discriminatory and violated federal civil rights laws. SEF contends that since the termination, it has not received pending payments owed to it and that will result in the permanent closure of SEF, thus causing significant harm to both it and to the constituents it serves.\n\nThe Plaintiff sued, asserting that the termination violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as arbitrary and capricious, contrary to notice and comment rulemaking procedures, and a violation of due process procedures. They also argue that the termination violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment as unconstitutionally vague, Title V of the Civil Rights Act, the free speech clause of the First Amendment as viewpoint discrimination and is ultra vires as an unlawful impoundment of congressionally appropriated funds.\n\nThe Plaintiff asked for a declaration that the termination is unlawful and setting it aside, and subsequently filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction against the enforcement of the termination.\n\nUpdate 1: On May 21, Judge Paul L. Friedman granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the grant award to EAC-South reinstated2025-05-21\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and AccessibilityExecutive Action: Department of Education \u201cDear Colleague Letter\u201d banning DEI-related programming (Dear Colleague Letter)American Federation of Teachers v.

The education interest groups argue that the letter violates constitutional rights, including freedom of speech and due process, and asks the court to declare the letter unlawful and unconstitutional and to immediately block its implementation and enforcement. The plaintiffs have also asked a federal judge to temporarily block enforcement of the DOE letter and related guidance and to remove certain content from the DOE website and restore other content all while the case proceeds. The judge has blocked implementation of the letter pending the outcome of the proceedings.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 14, 2025, the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights published a Dear Colleague Letter announcing its intentions for enforcing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which bans race-based affirmative action. According to the complaint, the Letter threatened to withhold federal funding from schools with DEI programs, programs that teach about \u201csystemic and structural racism,\u201d or programs that otherwise factor race into educational environments.\nPlaintiffs, professional membership associations representing teachers and sociologists, allege that the Letter violates the First Amendment\u2019s protections for freedom of speech and association, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process protections, and the Administrative Procedure Act. They seek declaratory judgment that the Letter is unlawful and unconstitutional and a preliminary injunction against any steps taken to implement the Letter.\nUpdate 1:  On Mar. 5, Plaintiffs amended their complaint to add a plaintiff (a school district in Oregon), additional factual allegations regarding the DOE\u2019s \u201cEnd DEI\u201d portal and Feb. 28 \u201cFAQs\u201d guidance document, and additional Oregon law relevant to the new plaintiff. \nUpdate 2: On Mar. 28, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction asking the court to enjoin defendants from initiating any investigations under both the Feb. 14 Dear Colleague Letter and the Feb. 28 FAQs, to order that the End DEI Portal be inactivated and removed from the DOE website, and to order that the DOE restore public website guidance related to Title VI that was removed after Jan 20, 2025.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 9, Plaintiffs filed another motion for an expedited preliminary injunction and stay of agency action, after the DOE sent state and local education agencies a Reminder of Legal Obligations Undertaken in Exchange for Receiving Federal Financial Assistance and Request for  Certification under Title VI and SFFA v.

The organizations argue that a target on DEI programs violates the Constitution, including the right to free speech and due process. The organizations are asking the judge to declare the letter unconstitutional and unlawful, and to block any steps to enforce the letter. On Apr. 24, the judge blocked the implementation and enforcement of the letter pending further court order\nCase Summary: On Feb. 14, 2025, the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights published a Dear Colleague Letter announcing its intentions for enforcing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which bans race-based affirmative action. According to the complaint, the Letter threatened to withhold federal funding from schools with DEI programs, programs that teach about \u201csystemic and structural racism,\u201d or programs that otherwise factor race into educational environments.\nPlaintiffs, a professional association that represents approximately 3 million educators and an affiliate, allege that the letter violates the First Amendment\u2019s protections for freedom of speech and association, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process protections, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They seek declaratory judgment that the Letter violates the APA and is unconstitutional and preliminary and permanent injunctions against any steps taken to implement the letter.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 21, Plaintiffs amended the complaint to include an additional plaintiff (Center for Black Educator Development (CBED)), factual allegations related to CBED, additional factual allegations related to NEA, and an additional cause of action under the Higher Education Opportunity Act\u2013which prohibits DOE from directing or controlling the curriculum of institutions of higher education.

DOE objected to the emergency motion on Apr. 8.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 9, DOE and Plaintiffs negotiated an agreement that prevents DOE from initiating enforcement action with respect to the Dear Colleague Letter and subsequent actions until after Apr. 24. Plaintiffs\u2019 emergency motion for a TRO was declared moot the following day.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 11, DOE filed its objection to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. DOE claimed Plaintiffs lack standing and that their APA claims will fail because the Dear Colleague Letter is not a final agency action. On Apr. 15, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 24, Judge Landya McCafferty granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction.

U.S. Department of Education (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01120\nComplaint2025-04-15Overview:  The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) sued the Department of Education (DOE), challenging a letter and related documents that the DOE had issued threatening to take away federal funding from schools with diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs or those teaching about systemic racism. The NAACP argues that the targeting of DEI programs violates the Constitution, including the right to free speech and due process. Plaintiff is asking the judge to declare the letter unconstitutional and unlawful, and to block any steps to enforce it. The judge has temporarily blocked the government\u2019s action\nCase Summary: On Feb. 14, 2025, the Department of Education Office for Civil Rights published a Dear Colleague Letter (Letter) announcing its intentions for enforcing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which bans race-based affirmative action. The DOE subsequently issued an accompanying Frequently Asked Questions Document on Feb. 28 and a certification of compliance requirement on Apr. 3 (collectively, Title VI Documents). \nThe NAACP filed suit against the DOE, the  Secretary of Education, and the Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights of the DOE alleging that the Title VI Documents violate the First Amendment\u2019s protections for freedom of speech and association; the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process protections; and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) due to being arbitrary and capricious, contrary to constitutional rights and separation of powers, and for exceeding statutory authority. Plaintiffs allege that by targeting programs that address racism and support equal educational opportunity, prohibiting policies that ensure equal access to selective programs, prohibiting curricula based on viewpoint, and prohibiting practices that address discrimination, the Title VI Documents are disproportionately harming Black students, including NAACP members.\n(In a separate lawsuit, the DOE reached an agreement not to enforce the directives in the Title VI Documents until at least April 24. However, the NAACP contends that the DOE continues to coerce schools to comply, as some schools have lost funding and others have cancelled programs under fear of future enforcement.)\nThe NAACP seek a declaratory judgment that the Title VI Documents violate the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses by evincing racially discriminatory intent, the First Amendment by infringing on the rights to receive information and freedom of association, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as arbitrary and capricious, for failure to follow required procedures to provide opportunity for participation in a rule making process, and in excess of statutory authority under Title VI, Equal Access Act, 20 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a74071-73 and Every Student Succeeds Act, 20 U.S.C \u00a77907.

The lawsuit alleges that OPM\u2019s directive to remove content promoting \"gender ideology\" from government-run forums violated their First Amendment rights and the Administrative Procedure Act on the ground that \u201cOPM has no authority, by statute or otherwise, to require agencies\u201d to remove such content.\nThe plaintiffs seek to reinstate removed materials and prevent further implementation of the OPM directive.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 1, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and supporting memorandum of law. Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendants\u2019 ongoing restrictions on Plaintiffs\u2019 speech because they are (1) viewpoint-based and unreasonable in violation of the First Amendment; and (2) arbitrary and capricious, in excess of OPM\u2019s statutory authority, and contravene a constitutional right in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 14, OPM filed its opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction.

Protect Democracy requests that the court declare OMB\u2019s decision unlawful and order OMB to restore the website.\nCase Summary: On or around Mar. 24, 2025, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) took down a publicly accessible website and database that it had previously maintained making available documents related to OMB decisions regarding apportionment of congressionally appropriated funds. On Apr. 15, Protect Democracy Project, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization, sued OMB and its director, Russell Voight, alleging that OMB is statutorily required to maintain this database and website. The Plaintiff claims that taking down the website has made it impossible for them to monitor the appropriation of funds and, in particular, has forced them to shut down OpenOMB, a site they operate, which pulls primary source data from OMB\u2019s site and creates a user-friendly interface used regularly by Congress, litigants and a wide variety of other users seeking to monitor appropriations.\nProtect Democracy argues that OMB\u2019s decision to take down this website and database is a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it violates (1) the 2022 and 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Acts, which together established the directive to create and maintain this database and website; and (2) the Paperwork Reduction Act, which requires that agencies provide adequate notice when initiating, substantially modifying, or terminating significant information dissemination products.

Department of Justice (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00325Complaint2025-02-04Overview: Nine Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) employees sued the Department of Justice on behalf of a class of current and former FBI agents alleging an FBI survey that seeks to identify agents involved in investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol is a violation of federal laws including the Privacy Act. A federal judge prohibited the government from publicly releasing any information collected via this survey while the case proceeds.\nCase Summary: After President Donald Trump\u2019s second inauguration, the Department of Justice terminated employees who were involved in investigations into the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol and President Donald Trump\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified documents. On February 2, FBI leadership, pursuant to a directive from the acting deputy attorney general, instructed agents to fill out a survey identifying their specific roles in those investigations.

Trump (N.D. Ca.)\n\nCase 3:25-cv-04870\n\nNinth Circuit docket no. 25-3727\nComplaint2025-06-09Overview:  California Governor Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, United States Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and the Department of Defense, challenging the Administration\u2019s decision to federalize 4,000 members of the California National Guard. Governor Newsom alleges that the statute that the President invoked to justify these orders does not authorize the President to call members of a State\u2019s National Guard into service over the objections of that State\u2019s Governor, and further that other statutory requirements have not been met in this instance. Governor Newsom has asked the court to declare that the Administration\u2019s actions are unauthorized, and for injunctive relief to prevent Defendants from federalizing and deploying the California National Guard.\nCase Summary: On June 7, 2025, President Donald Trump issued a memorandum that called into federal service members of the California National Guard to respond to protests related to the Administration\u2019s efforts to enforce immigration laws. United States Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth subsequently issued two sets of orders shortly thereafter, ordering a total of 4,000 California National Guard members into federal service. President Trump\u2019s memo invoked 10 U.S.C. 12406 as authority to call these National Guard members into federal service. Plaintiffs California Governor Gavin Newsom and the State of California brought suit against President Trump, Secretary Hegseth, and the Department of Defense, alleging that Section 12406 does not provide the President with authority to federalize a State\u2019s National Guard without consultation and permission from the State\u2019s Governor. Governor Newsom argues that this is a violation of the Governor\u2019s authority as Commander in Chief of the California National Guard, that California already had sufficient resources to respond to the protests, and that diverting 4,000 service members impairs the Governor\u2019s ability to call upon the National Guard for emergencies and to carry out other critical functions. Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants\u2019 acted ultra vires, because the statute does not provide authority for the President to federalize National Guard members without going through the Governor, and further that the conditions articulated in the statute have not otherwise been met. Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants\u2019 actions violate the Tenth Amendment, and further that Secretary Hegseth\u2019s and the Department of Defense\u2019s actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act as arbitrary and capricious agency action.

Md.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-01807Complaint2025-06-09Overview:  A coalition of states on Jun. 9 filed a lawsuit contesting the administration\u2019s reversal of a Biden-era effort to stop distribution of \u201cforced-reset trigger\u201d devices, which turn semi-automatic rifles into makeshift machine guns. The states argue that the executive order exceeds the administration\u2019s authority and violates the Administrative Procedure Act.\nCase Summary: Starting in 1934, the National Firearms Act (NFA) as well as several subsequent Congressional acts have regulated the manufacture, importation, sale, or other disposal of certain types of firearms, including weapons defined as \u201ca machinegun\u201d. Machinegun conversion devices (MCDs) are devices that are used to convert a semi-automatic firearm, which requires a shooter to release and pull the trigger for each shot they fire, into a machinegun that fires automatically. The \u201cforced reset trigger,\u201d or \u201cFRT,\u201d is a type of MCD that is designed to replace the standard trigger assembly on an AR-15-type rifle. Since the 1970s, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) has consistently classified devices functionally similar to FRTs as prohibited machineguns under federal law. \nOver the last few years, ATF undertook enforcement efforts that succeeded in enjoining distributors from selling FRTs and FRT equipped weapons, and conducted extensive retrieval operations, seizing nearly 12,000 FRTs from the field. In 2023, ATF brought an enforcement action against Defendant Rare Breed Triggers (RBG) in New York, after which the district court issued a preliminary injunction against the continued distribution of FRT\u2019s (subsequently appealed to the Second Circuit), and a civil forfeiture action in the District of Utah against certain of RBG\u2019s subcontractors (collectively, the RBG Defendants).\nIn August 2023, Defendant National Association of Gun rights (NAGR) challenged the ATF\u2019s classifications of the FRT-15 as machineguns in the Northern District of Texas, and in July 2024, the district court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and vacated and set aside the challenged classifications, enjoined the United States from implementing or enforcing ATF\u2019s \u201cexpanded definition of \u2018machinegun\u2019\u201d against the plaintiffs to the suit, enjoined the United States from pursuing criminal enforcement actions against the RBT Defendants, and ordered the United States to return any FRTs \u201cseized pursuant to their unlawful classification\u201d to all parties in that litigation within 30 days. The United States appealed the NAGR decision.\nOn February 7, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14,206 titled \u201cProtecting Second Amendment Rights,\u201d which directed Defendant Bondi to review, among other things, all rules ATF promulgated between 2021 and 2025, and all positions taken by the federal government in lawsuits related to firearms. On May 16, 2025, Defendants entered into a settlement agreement (the Agreement), which resolved all three of the above actions in New York, Utah and Texas. The Agreement states that the Government will not enforce any statute or agency interpretation under which an FRT is \u201ccontended to be\u201d a machinegun provided that the FRTs are not designed for use in handguns, and purports to bind the government perpetually and universally from enforcing the NFA against FRTs.The Agreement also commits the federal government to return FRTs that any federal agency \u201chas seized or taken as a result of a voluntary surrender\u201d in response to any request received by September 30, 2025 (the \u201cRedistribution Policy\u201d). This Redistribution Policy is not limited to the states that are the subject of the Agreement and instead requires the government to return FRTs to any entity or individual from whom they were seized. The Agreement includes no carve outs on its face that would exclude returns to individuals or entities located in States that bar the possession of FRTs or FRT-equipped firearms or individuals who are barred from possessing firearms by federal law such as convicted felons.\nPlaintiffs, a coalition of 14 states, the District of Columbia and Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the \u201cPlaintiff States\u201d), filed a complaint with an accompanying memorandum of support on June 9, 2025, contending that the government\u2019s decision to reverse its position on the redistribution of FRT\u2019s will impose \u201cserious sovereign and fiscal injuries\u201d on them by increasing the number of FRTs in their jurisdictions. The complaint notes that at least 14 of the Plaintiff States have state laws that independently prohibit FRTs or FRT-equipped firearms, and since the Redistribution Policy does not include a carve out for individuals who are prohibited from possessing firearms under state laws, ATF is injuring the States\u2019 sovereign interests by facilitating the violation of their laws. Plaintiffs also contend that States will incur greater law enforcement costs from having to enforce these state prohibitions, and that because it is substantially likely that the Redistribution Policy will lead to the increased use of FRTs, including in criminal incidents, they will incur additional law enforcement costs in general as well as increased health care and emergency medical response costs.\nThe Plaintiff States seek a declaration that the Redistribution Policy is ultra vires as it contravenes NFA laws regulating machine guns and violates the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) as an action by an administrative agency in excess of statutory right. They ask the court for the preliminary and permanent enjoinment of implementation or enforcement of the Redistribution Policy and ask the court to vacate and set aside the Agreement.2025-06-09\n\n\nTransparencyExecutive Action: Response to FOIA and Records RetentionCREW v. DOGE (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00511Complaint2025-02-20Overview: Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (a non-profit government watchdog) sued the Department of Government Efficiency (\u201cDOGE\u201d) and related federal officials, alleging violations of transparency laws and seeking the preservation and release of certain DOGE records. The district court has ordered discovery in favor of plaintiffs, and the government has appealed to the Supreme Court. On Jun. 6, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to halt discovery orders that would have required DOGE to turn over internal communications.\nCase Summary: Plaintiff claims that the United States DOGE Service (USDS) \u201chas provided no meaningful transparency into its operations or assurances that it is maintaining proper records.\u201d The complaint alleges that Defendants have refused to comply with FOIA requests for records and demands for records preservation under the Federal Records Act (FRA). Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief requiring Defendants to comply with Plaintiff\u2019s FOIA requests, to fully comply with the FRA\u2019s preservation requirements, and to initiate enforcement action through the Attorney General to recover any lost or destroyed USDS records. Plaintiff also filed a motion, with a supporting memorandum, for preliminary injunction to require Defendants to release records in advance of the March 14 conclusion of the congressional appropriations process.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 10, Judge Christopher Cooper granted in part and denied in part CREW\u2019s request for a preliminary junction. In an accompanying memorandum opinion, the judge found that USDS \u201cis likely covered by FOIA\u201d and ordered it to process CREW\u2019s request for records \u201con an expedited timetable,\u201d but denied CREW\u2019s request for an order demanding that OMB and USDS release records by the day of the order.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 14, USDS filed a motion requesting reconsideration of the judge\u2019s decision regarding the preliminary injunction. USDS also requested an expedited briefing schedule on USDS\u2019s upcoming motion for summary judgment.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 19, USDS filed a motion for summary judgment. In an accompanying memorandum, USDS reasserted that, because it does not wield substantial independent authority, it is not an agency and is therefore not subject to FOIA or the FRA.\nUpdate 4: On Mar. 26, USDS filed their answer to CREW\u2019s complaint, largely denying CREW\u2019s claims and reasserting defenses that USDS is not an agency subject to FOIA or the FRA; CREW is not entitled to information exempt from FOIA disclosure; and USDS\u2019s actions did not violate FOIA, the FRA, or any other statutory or regulatory provision.\nUpdate 5: On Mar. 27, CREW filed a motion for expedited discovery to allow them to gather information regarding USDS\u2019s agency status and whether it is subject to FOIA and the FRA. CREW argued that it needs this discovery in order to respond to Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.\nUpdate 6: On Apr. 8, USDS filed an opposition to CREW\u2019s motion for expedited discovery and requested for CREW\u2019s motion to be denied or at least limited in scope. CREW replied on Apr. 10, reiterating that it is entitled to expedited discovery in order to meaningfully respond to USDS\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment.\nUpdate 7: On Apr. 15, Judge Cooper granted in part and denied in part CREW\u2019s motion for expedited discovery and determined that CREW is entitled to limited discovery. Judge Cooper ordered USDS to serve responses and objections to CREW within seven days, produce all responsive documents within fourteen days, and complete all depositions within twenty four days.\nThat same day, the Defendants appealed to the DC Circuit requesting a mandamus order to halt Judge Cooper\u2019s Apr. 15 discovery order.\nUpdate 8: On Apr. 18, the DC Circuit granted an administrative stay.\nUpdate 9: On May 14, the DC Circuit dissolved the administrative stay and denied the defendants\u2019 petition for a writ of mandamus.\nUpdate 10: On May 21, the government appealed to the Supreme Court asking for a stay of the discovery order including the deposition by the putative head of DOGE, Amy Gleason.\nUpdate 11: Chief Justice John Roberts issued a temporary administrative stay blocking orders that DOGE comply with mandated expedited discovery, including deposition of Amy Gleason.\nUpdate 12: On Jun. 6, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to stay the lower courts\u2019 action, and also to treat the petition as a writ for certiorari. The Court ruled that the district court could not order the Government, in discovery, \u201cto disclose the content of intra\u2013Executive Branch USDS recommendations and whether those recommendations were followed.\u201d On remand, the Court of Appeals is instructed to narrow the discovery order with deference to internal Executive Branch communications.\n2025-06-06\n\n\nTransparencyExecutive Action: Response to FOIA and Records RetentionAmerican Oversight v.

A federal judge also granted American Oversight\u2019s request that DOGE preserve its records while the case is pending.\nCase Summary: On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 14158 establishing the Department of Government Efficiency (\u201dDOGE\u201d). Plaintiff American Oversight, a non-profit organization that promotes government transparency, submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d) to DOGE, the office of Management and Budget (\u201cOMB\u201d) and other federal agencies seeking certain records relating to Trump\u2019s recent termination of numerous Inspectors General under the assumption that such agencies were involved in discussions surrounding the firings. Plaintiff did not receive the requested record and filed this lawsuit asking the court to compel DOGE and OMB to process these FOIA requests on an expedited basis and conduct a reasonable search for responsive records. Plaintiff also seeks compensation for the costs of this proceeding.\nUpdate 1: On Mar, 5, plaintiff filed an amended complaint which added more information to the statement of facts section and added two more FOIA violation counts.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 24, plaintiff filed a motion for preservation order asking the court to order defendants to  preserve records responsive to the FOIA requests and inform the Court whether such records have been preserved to date.\nUpdate 3: On Mar. 28, DOGE DOGE and OMB filed an opposition to the motion for a preservation order. American Oversight filed a reply in support of its motion for preservation order on the same day.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 2, Judge Beryl Howell granted Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preservation order.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 21, Defendants filed an answer to the amended complaint. While Defendants acknowledge that \u201cthere may be some public interest in the records sought,\u201d Defendants dispute that DOGE is subject to FOIA and that Plaintiffs are entitled to compel production of any documents from DOGE.2025-04-21\n\n\nTransparencyExecutive Action: Response to FOIA and Records RetentionProject on Government Oversight, Inc. v. Trump (D.D.C)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00527Complaint2025-02-21Overview:  A nonprofit organization focused on government oversight has challenged the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s (DOGE\u2019s) record-keeping policies, alleging DOGE has misclassified agency records in violation of several federal laws. The organization has asked the court to declare DOGE\u2019s handling of records unlawful and order DOGE to handle and preserve records according to applicable federal laws.\nCase Summary: Plaintiff alleges that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has \u201crun roughshod over record keeping requirements,\u201d including by misclassifying agency records as covered by the Presidential Records Act (PRA) (rather than the Freedom of Information Act) and requiring partner agencies to notify DOGE of any oversight requests related to DOGE\u2019s work.\nPlaintiffs, an oversight-focused nonprofit \u201cthat relies on records from agencies ... to disseminate to inform and educate the public,\u201d alleges that DOGE\u2019s actions violate the Presidential Records Act and Federal Records Act (FRA). \nThey seek declaratory judgment that DOGE\u2019s actions are arbitrary, capricious, and illegal, and injunctive and mandamus relief ordering DOGE to treat its records as subject to the Federal Records and Freedom of Information Acts.\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 24, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to collect, maintain, and preserve records consistent with the Federal Records Act.\nUpdate 2: On April 7, the Defendants filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction. They argue that the Plaintiff lacks standing, failed to demonstrate irreparable harm, is unlikely to succeed on the merits as they raise no permissible FRA or PRA claim, and fail to establish that DOGE is an agency. They also contend that the court lacks jurisdiction to enjoin the President. \nUpdate 3: On Apr. 23, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction in which they urged the court to issue a preliminary injunction to ensure all of DOGE\u2019s records are preserved before they are beyond reach.\nUpdate 4: On May 9, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which included additional facts about DOGE\u2019s March 25, 2025 records retention policy. Plaintiff added a request that this policy also be deemed arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.\nUpdate 5: On May 15, Plaintiff filed a renewed motion for a preliminary injunction and supporting memorandum. Plaintiff requested that the court order Defendants to collect, retain, and preserve their records pursuant to a FRA-compliant recordkeeping policy.\nUpdate 6: On June 17, Judge James E. Boasberg denied Plaintiff\u2019s preliminary injunction motion. In the supporting memorandum, Judge Boasberg noted Plaintiff failed to show a likelihood of irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction.2025-06-17\n\n\nTransparencyExecutive Action: Response to FOIA and Records RetentionDemocracy Forward Foundation v.

U.S. Marshals Service (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-00749Complaint2025-03-14Overview: A not-for-profit organization filed several Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests following alleged reports of irregular conduct by the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS). USMS has identified 674 of potentially responsive records and has indicated it aims to begin its production of these documents to the organization by July 31, 2025.\nCase Summary: On Jan. 27 and Feb. 7, 2025, Democracy Forward Foundation, a non-profit organization, filed several Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) seeking records following allegations that USMS may be following directions from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Allegations include (1) inappropriate communication with federal judges regarding cases related to January 6, (2) DOGE-affiliated individuals invoking threats to engage USMS when attempting to access agency buildings and information, and (3) the deputizing of DOGE leader Elon Musk\u2019s private security guards by USMS. Considering USMS\u2019s role in the enforcement of court orders, Plaintiff also filed these FOIA requests after Vice President Vance made comments that may call into question whether court orders would be followed.\nThe Plaintiff states USMS failed to respond within the statutorily mandated time period under FOIA and seeks an order from the court for the Defendants to comply with the FOIA requests. \nUpdate 1: On Apr. 21, USMS filed its answer to Democracy Forward\u2019s complaint. USMS admitted and acknowledged receipt of Democracy Forward\u2019s FOIA requests , but denied that Plaintiff is entitled to relief.

Hegseth (D.D.C.)\n\nCase no. 1:25-cv-00883Complaint2025-03-25Overview: After reports that top administration officials used the messaging app Signal to discuss military operations in Yemen, a transparency nonprofit filed suit, alleging that using an outside communications app with an auto-delete function to conduct agency business violates the Federal Records Act (FRA) and Administrative Procedure Act (APA). They seek preservation of records and compliance with the FRA and APA\u2019s obligations. The district court denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion in large part, including for lack of available remedies. \nCase Summary: On Mar. 24, The Atlantic reported that members of the Trump administration used the commercial messaging app Signal to discuss military operations in Yemen (see also Mar. 26 follow-up report). Signal messages are not automatically forwarded to government email addresses, and the app has a functionality that allows messages to auto-delete, which was allegedly enabled during the Yemen discussions. American Oversight, a nonprofit focused on government transparency that regularly files Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with the federal government, filed suit against federal agency officials and the National Archives, arguing they are injured because government use of Signal prevents Plaintiffs from receiving lawfully requested records. Plaintiffs allege Defendants\u2019 use of Signal violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because (1) Defendants' use Signal is not in accordance with the Federal Records Act (FRA) and amounts to removal and destruction of agency records; and (2) National Archives defendants should have known records were being removed and destroyed (the acting National Archivist, Marco Rubio, was allegedly in the group Signal chat) and failed to take nondiscretionary actions to preserve them under the FRA. Plaintiffs seek declaratory judgments that messages sent through Signal in the course of agency business are subject to the FRA, that failure to preserve them is a violation of the FRA, and that defendants have violated the FRA. They seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief ordering defendants to preserve records in accordance with the law.\n\nUpdate 1: On Mar. 26, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to order Defendants to stop allegedly destroying records, initiate actions to recover any destroyed records related to the Yemen Signal chat, and take steps to confirm that any use of a messaging app with an auto-delete function complies with the Federal Records Act.\nUpdate 2: On Mar. 27, after a hearing, Chief Judge James Boasberg issued an order, \u201cas agreed by the parties,\u201d for \u201cDefendants shall promptly make best efforts to preserve all Signal communications from March 11-15, 2025.\u201d The court also ordered defendants to file a status report by Mar. 31 \u201csetting forth the steps that they have taken to implement such preservation.\u201d\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 10, following a hearing, the court ordered the Defendants to provide supplemental declarations to address \u201cspecific clarifications\u201d missing from the first round of declarations.\nUpdate 4: On Apr. 21, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint reflecting additional details of Defendants\u2019 alleged violations of federal record-keeping laws, including additional reporting on their use of Signal group chats and admissions by Defendants that they had failed to fully preserve records of their conversations. In addition to prior allegations, the amended complaint alleges that these failures to preserve records, or to take enforcement actions against individuals known to have failed to preserve records, violate the Administrative Procedure Act.\nUpdate 5: On Apr. 22, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction ordering Defendants to take actions to preserve records of their Signal messages. Plaintiffs also filed a memorandum in support of the motion, reasserting the allegations in their amended complaint that Defendants violated federal record-keeping laws by failing to preserve the chats.\nUpdate 6: On May 7, the Defendants filed a memorandum in opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, claiming that the Plaintiff cannot demonstrate a likelihood of irreparable harm or a likelihood of success on the merits, and that the balance of equities disfavor granting the Plaintiff\u2019s motion.\nUpdate 7: On May 14, Plaintiffs filed a reply in support of its motion for a preliminary injunction. \nUpdate 8: On June 20th, Judge Boasberg granted in part and denied in part the Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, granting a narrower relief by requiring that Defendants perform their mandatory notification and referral obligations, as explained in its accompanying memorandum opinion.2025-06-20\n\n\nTransparencyExecutive Action: Response to FOIA and Records RetentionDemocracy Forward Foundation v.

On Mar. 18, 2025, DOGE denied the requests arguing it was not subject to FOIA because it is not an \u201cagency.\u201d The Intercept alleges that DOGE and USDS have violated FOIA by not providing the requested records and have caused the Intercept irreparable injury by preventing it from educating the public about DOGE\u2019s activities. Plaintiff seeks a judgment that DOGE and USDS\u2019s withholding of requested records violates FOIA and an order requiring DOGE and USDS to immediately release all responsive records to the Plaintiff, as well as an order to preserve all potentially responsive records.\nUpdate 1: On Apr 28, 2025, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case arguing Plaintiff failed to plausibly allege that USDS and DOGE are \u201cagencies\u201d subject to FOIA.\nUpdate 2: On May 12, Plaintiff responded in opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.2025-05-12\n\n\nTransparencyExecutive Action: Response to FOIA and Records RetentionCREW v.

Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) brought suit against HHS, the CDC, and the heads of the respective entities, alleging that the closures violate FOIA by denying processing of requests and constitute an unlawful arbitrary and capricious action under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).

CREW argues that taking down the website makes it impossible for them to monitor for potential withholding of appropriated funds, identify misuse of funds, request related records, and otherwise rely on such information.\nCREW argues that OMB\u2019s decision to take down this website and database is a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). CREW argues that the decision is contrary to law under the APA because it violates (1) the 2022 and 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Acts, which together established the directive to create and maintain this database and website; and (2) the Paperwork Reduction Act, which requires that agencies provide adequate notice when initiating, substantially modifying, or terminating significant\ninformation dissemination products.

CREW requested that the court issue a preliminary injunction requiring OMB to restore the Public Apportionments Database and the apportionment information they unlawfully removed.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 30, OMB filed its opposition to CREW\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and partial summary judgment. OMB asserted that CREW lacks standing and that its claims are without merit.\nUpdate 3: On May 4, CREW replied to OMB\u2019s opposition to CREW\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 4: On May 5, OMB filed a sur-reply to plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and for a partial motion for summary judgment reiterating their allegation that CREW\u2019s request for preliminary injunction and partial summary judgement fails.2025-05-05\n\n\nTransparencyExecutive Action: Response to FOIA and Records RetentionDemocracy Forward Foundation v.

U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (D.D.C.)\n\nCase No  1:25-cv-01251Complaint2025-04-23Overview code: Overview:   On April 23, American Oversight, a nonpartisan, non-profit corporation which collects, analyses and disseminates information about the activities and operations of the federal government,  filed suit against a number of Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) entities and individuals, as well as against the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and its acting head. Plaintiff argues that DOGE\u2019s use of ephemeral messaging and document systems such as Signal and Google Docs violates the Federal Records Act (FRA) and by failing to comply with the FRA, the heads of DOGE and NARA violate the Administrative Procedure Act. Plaintiff also argues that Defendants violate the Freedom of Information Act by failing to produce requested documents. \nCase Summary: On April 23, 2025, American Oversight, a nonpartisan, non-profit corporation which collects, analyses and disseminates information about the activities and operations of the federal government, filed suit against the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE); Elon Musk, Steve Davis, and Amy Gleason in their official capacities as DOGE leaders; the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); and Marco Rubio in his official capacity as Acting Archivist. Plaintiff argues that DOGE\u2019s use of ephemeral messaging and document systems such as Signal and Google Docs violates the Federal Records Act (FRA) and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) because such systems do not preserve records as required by the statutes. Plaintiff\u2019s interest in ensuring Defendants\u2019 compliance with their recordkeeping obligations stems from its filing a number of FOIA requests seeking information about DOGE\u2019s activities, none of which have been fulfilled. \nPlaintiff argues that Musk, Davis, and Gleason violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by acting in an arbitrary and capricious manner, abusing their discretion, and acting contrary to the law. They contend that as agency heads, Defendants are obligated to preserve federal records per the FRA, but their failure to prevent the automatic deletion of records in ephemeral systems is contrary to such obligations. Plaintiffs argue that Defendants NARA and Rubio violate the APA, also for arbitrary and capricious action, abuse of discretion, and acting contrary to the law, because NARA and Rubio have an obligation under FRA to initiate an action for recovery of documents through the Attorney General when an agency head fails to do so, and that  NARA and Rubio have failed to take such action. Plaintiff further argues that the DOGE Defendants are in violation of FOIA because they failed to conduct adequate searches for records responsive to Plaintiff\u2019s FOIA requests and to provide all responsive non-exempt records. Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. 2025-04-23\n\n\nTransparencyExecutive Action: Response to FOIA and Records RetentionAmerican Oversight v.

Trump (W.D. Wa.)\n\nCase No. 2:25-cv-00869Complaint2025-05-09Overview:  A group of States and the District of Columbia challenged Executive Order (EO) 14156, \u201cDeclaring a National Energy Emergency\u201d, alleging that the EO improperly invokes emergency powers under the National Emergencies Act (NEA). The States argue that the EO does not show sufficient cause for claiming an emergency under the NEA and that using emergency powers to rollback permitting requirements for energy projects threatens plaintiff States\u2019 environments, natural resources, citizens, and control over their territories.    They seek an order to declare EO 14156 unlawful, to set aside agency actions taken pursuant to EO 14156, and to pause any existing projects granted authorizations or permits under EO 14156. \nCase Summary: On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14156 claiming a \u201cNational Energy Emergency\u201d under the National Emergencies Act (NEA) and ordering the heads of Federal Agencies to forego ordinary environmental reviews, as required by the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act, and to issue permits for energy projects on an expedited basis. Although the EO implicates all government agencies, it specifically targets the permits, authorizations, and construction projects overseen by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), the Department of the Interior, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP). Plaintiffs, 15 States, argue that Trump\u2019s invocation of a national emergency to justify expedited energy project authorizations is an ultra vires abuse of authority under the NEA and request a declaration that the EO is unlawful. They further argue that expedited permitting actions by the USACE, the Department of the Interior, and the ACHP violate the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) as both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious actions. The Plaintiff States seek preliminary and permanent injunctions for all existing projects given expedited authorizations under the EO and the cessation of all future expedited authorizations under the EO. 2025-06-11\n\n\nEnvironmentExecutive Action: Halting Wind Energy ApprovalsState of New York v. Trump (D. Mass.)\n\nCase No. 1:25-cv-11221Complaint2025-05-05Overview:  A group of States and the District of Columbia challenged the indefinite halt on approvals of wind energy projects by the federal government, alleging that the government had not issued the declaration in accordance with law. They seek an order to set aside the indefinite pause on wind energy development.\nCase Summary: On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum that categorically and indefinitely halted all federal approvals necessary for the development of offshore- and onshore-wind energy, pending an inter-agency review. The Memorandum orders that federal agencies \u201cnot issue new or rendered approvals, rights of way, permits, leases, or loans for onshore or offshore wind projects pending the completion of a comprehensive assessment and review of Federal wind leasing and permitting practices\u201d. Plaintiffs, 17 States and the District of Columbia, seek a declaration that the adoption and implementation of this directive is a violation of the APA, a violation of federal environmental laws, and ultra vires. They also seek a preliminary injunction to prevent the federal government from implementing or otherwise giving effect to any action that halts or impedes wind energy development based on the directive. \nUpdate 1: On Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction, requesting that the Court enjoin the defendant federal agencies from implementing or giving effect to the directive.\nUpdate 2: On May 29, the defendant federal agencies filed their opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. 2025-06-18\n\n\nEnvironmentExecutive Action: Halting Wind Energy ApprovalsProtect Our Coast NJ v. United States of America (D. N.J.)\n\nCase No. 3:25-cv-06890Complaint2025-06-03Overview code: Overview:  Fishing and trade groups, environmental nonprofits, and the Mayor of Seaside Park, New Jersey, filed suit to block a reinstatement order allowing work on the Empire Wind offshore wind project to resume, after the Secretary of Interior\u2019s initial stop work order, based on the Trump Administration\u2019s executive action to temporarily suspend and prevent approvals of wind energy projects, was reversed.\n\nCase Summary: On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum that indefinitely halted all federal approvals necessary for the development of wind energy and required that the Secretary of the Interior investigate all offshore wind projects to determine if they will cause ecological, environmental or economic harm. Plaintiffs are fisheries and fishing industry participants, trade groups, coastal environment nonprofits, and the mayor of Seaside Park, New Jersey, who are all claiming harm from the offshore wind Empire Wind project. Defendants are the United States, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and its Acting Director Walter Cruickshank, Empire Wind, Equinor (owner of Empire Wind), and the Kingdom of Norway (the controlling owner of Equinor). Pursuant to the Memorandum, a stop work order was issued on Apr. 16, 2025, that stopped all work on Empire Wind until an investigation was completed. On May 19, 2025, the stop work order was reversed by BOEM and a reinstatement order allowing work to resume on Empire Wind was issued. Plaintiffs are arguing that the May 19 reinstatement order violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because it is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. Plaintiffs also claim that the reinstatement order violates the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA), which prohibits Norway, as a foreign government, from acquiring a lease on the outer continental shelf of the U.S. Plaintiffs are requesting that the court declare that the May 19 reinstatement order was unlawful and an injunction directing that the reinstatement order be vacated and BOEM to resume investigating Empire Wind. \nUpdate 1: On Jun. 12, Plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion for order to show cause, seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent Defendants from proceeding with installation and construction activities for Empire Wind. 2025-07-03\n\n\nTrade LawExecutive Action: TariffsEmily Ley Paper, Inc. v Trump (N.D. Fla.) \n\nCase No. 3:25-cv-00464Complaint2025-04-03Overview:  A Florida-based corporation that sources products from China challenged President Donald Trump\u2019s Feb. 1 and Mar. 3 Executive Orders (EOs) imposing tariffs on China, which resulted in the modification of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). This corporation requests that the Court declare the China EOs and resulting HTSUS modifications unlawful and unconstitutional, block Defendants from implementing or enforcing the tariffs, and set aside the modifications to the tariff schedule.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 1 and Mar. 3, President Donald Trump issued Executive Orders (EOs) imposing tariffs on all imports from China, which resulted in modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). The Plaintiff, a Florida-based corporation specializing in office products sourced from China, alleges economic harm due to lost profits that will result from these tariffs.\nTrump issued the EOs under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA), which empowers the President to impose sanctions in response to international emergencies. However, the Plaintiff contends Trump has failed to demonstrate the necessity of these tariffs to address his stated emergency. Furthermore, Plaintiff argues the IEEPA does not authorize the imposition of tariffs, that the EOs issuing the tariffs are an unconstitutional exercise of legislative power, and that the IEEPA violates the Nondelegation Doctrine under Article I of the Constitution. Additionally, Plaintiff asserts that the HTSUS modifications resulting from the tariffs contravene the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)as arbitrary and capricious (5 U.S.C. \u00a7706(2)(A)), contrary to constitutional rights (5 U.S.C. \u00a7706(2)(B)) and in excess of statutory jurisdiction (5 U.S.C. \u00a7706(2)(C).\nPlaintiff seeks a judicial declaration that the EOs and the resulting HTSUS modifications are unlawful and unconstitutional. Plaintiff also requests an injunction to prevent Defendants from implementing or enforcing the tariffs as well as an order to set aside the modifications to the tariff schedule. \nUpdate 1: On Apr. 14, Defendants filed a motion to transfer the case to the Court of International Trade. The motion argues that transfer is required because the Court of International Trade has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over the Complaint. \nUpdate 2: On May 5, Plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to the Defendants\u2019 motion to transfer, and an unopposed motion to expedite. In opposing the motion to transfer, the Plaintiffs argue that the case falls outside of the CIT\u2019s jurisdiction as IEEPA does not provide for tariffs. The Plaintiffs also filed an amended complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief, thoroughly expanding on their previous arguments.2025-05-05\n\n\nTrade LawExecutive Action: TariffsSusan Webber et al v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security et al (D. Mont.)\n\nCase No. \n4:25-cv-00026-JTJ\nComplaint2025-04-04Overview:  Plaintiffs Susan Webber and Jonathan St. Goddard challenged President Donald Trump\u2019s Executive Orders and related proclamations establishing tariffs and duties on imports from Canada. Plaintiffs are both members of the Blackfeet Nation in Montana. Plaintiffs argue that President Trump does not have constitutional or statutory authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, and that the Executive Orders and related proclamations violate the Separation of Powers, the Constitution, and the Jay Treaty. Plaintiffs ask the court to stop the implementation of the Executive Orders and related proclamations, or to stay the tariffs at specific ports of entry in Montana, or to stay all tariffs imposed for tribal members. On Apr. 28, 2025, the Court granted the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s motion to transfer the case to the US International Court of Trade.\nCase Summary. On February 1, 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 14193 (Imposing Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across our Northern Border), and subsequently amended that Executive Order through Executive Orders 14197 and 14231. These Executive Orders declare a national emergency and invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to impose certain tariffs, including on goods from Canada. Additionally, on February 10, Trump issued Proclamations 10895 and 10896 imposing additional tariffs on aluminum and steel products under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Finally, on April 2, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14257 (Regulating Imports with a Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices that Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits) that imposed additional tariffs on countries around the world, including Canada.\nPlaintiffs are two members of the Blackfeet Nation in Montana who conduct personal and economic business across the U.S.-Canada border in Montana. They allege that the Executive Orders and related proclamations will increase the cost of goods for the tribal community in their personal and business lives.\nPlaintiffs allege that President Trump acted ultra vires in establishing the tariffs on goods from Canada, because the President does not have constitutional or statutory authority to impose tariffs, and that these tariffs would violate the Jay Treaty exempting Native Americans from being subject to duties or tariffs when crossing the border. Plaintiffs also argue that the IEEPA does not empower the President to establish tariffs. They further allege that the Executive Orders and related proclamations violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and that the Executive Orders and related proclamations are unconstitutionally vague.\nPlaintiffs requested that the court declare the Executive Orders and related proclamations unconstitutional as violative of the Separation of Powers, Article I, Article VI, and the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, and of the Jay Treaty. They asked the court to preliminarily and permanently enjoin the orders, declare that tariffs cannot be imposed on cross-border transactions at Montana ports of entry, and that tariffs cannot be imposed on tribal members.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 4, Plaintiffs filed a motion and accompanying brief seeking a preliminary and permanent injunction. Plaintiffs claim that they are likely to succeed on the merits on the bases that the Executive Orders exceed Constitutional authority, statutory authority, and are in violation of the Jay Treaty, as well as due process.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 11, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, adding Plaintiffs David and Rhonda Mountain Chief.\nUpdate 3: The Court granted the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s motion to transfer the case to the US International Court of Trade and transferred the case on April 28, 2025 without addressing any of the merits of the complaint. Plaintiffs have appealed the transfer.2025-04-28\n\n\nTrade LawExecutive Action: TariffsV.O.S. Selections Inc. v. Trump\n(U.S. Court of International Trade) \n\nCase no. 1:25-cv-00066-N/AComplaint2025-04-14Overview:  Five businesses that rely on international imports filed suit in the United States Court of International Trade against President Trump and his administration, challenging the implementation of tariffs under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). They alleged that the imposition of across-the-board tariffs is not authorized under the IEEPA and in any event exceeds the Defendants' executive authority as they were implemented without congressional approval. The businesses requested that the court block the imposition of the tariffs, but the court denied this request. On May 28, the court held the tariffs unlawful, but the appeals court imposed a temporary stop to that order the following day and extended the stop while the litigation proceeds.\nCase Summary: On Apr. 2, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14257 (the \u201cLiberation Day Order\u201d) imposing incremental tariffs of 10% on all imports into the United States as well as elevated tariffs on individual countries.  Subsequent EOs, including EO 14266 and additional memoranda, paused many of the elevated tariffs but increased the tariff on most goods from China to 145%. As the statutory basis for the Liberation Day Order, the EO cites the International Emergency Economic Powers Act  (IEEPA), which provides the President with certain authority in the event of \u201can unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared.\u201d The Liberation Day Order asserts that the existence of bilateral trade deficits in goods constitutes a national emergency.\nOn Apr. 14, five owner-operated businesses, which are unable to source their products or raw materials domestically and therefore rely on international imports to run their companies, sued President Trump and various government agencies, alleging that the levying of tariffs is not authorized under the IEEPA. They contend that given the significance of the economic impact on the United States, the \u201cmajor questions doctrine\u201d requires that Congress must have clearly delegated authority for tariffs under the IEEPA. Plaintiffs also argue that in any event a trade deficit in goods is neither an emergency nor an unusual or extraordinary threat, and that if the IEEPA did extend such power to the President, it would be an unconstitutional delegation of Congress\u2019s power to impose tariffs.\nPlaintiffs seek a declaratory judgement that the IEEPA does not provide statutory authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, that neither the national emergency nor the \u201cunusual and extraordinary threat\u201d required by the IEEPA has been identified, and that the imposition of tariffs under the EO\u2019s is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, and seek the enjoin the operation of the Liberation Day Order and EO 14266.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 18, Plaintiffs filed a motion requesting the court to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction and/or enter summary judgment for a permanent injunction. In this motion, Plaintiffs requested the Court block the imposition of all tariffs set forth in EO 14257 and award money damages to cover what Plaintiffs have already paid as a result of the tariffs.\nUpdate 2: On Apr. 21, Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 Apr. 18 TRO motion and asserted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion fails to satisfy any of the requirements for extraordinary remedy. The court ultimately denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion on Apr. 22.\nUpdate 3: On Apr. 29, Defendants responded in opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction and summary judgment motions, asserting the IEEPA authorizes the President to \u201cregulate\u201d importation during a national emergency by imposing tariffs and that Trump\u2019s emergency declaration is a nonjusticiable political question.\nUpdate 4: On May 6, the Plaintiffs filed a reply brief in support of their motion for preliminary injunction and motion for summary judgment, claiming that the Plaintiffs are likely to prevail on the merits, will suffer irreparable harm if the tariffs imposed by Executive Order 14257 remain in effect, and that the public interest favors the granting of a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 5: On May 28, the court granted plaintiffs summary judgment holding the tariffs unlawful.\nUpdate 6: On May 29, the Federal Circuit granted an administrative stay while the case is on appeal.\nUpdate 7: On June 10, the Federal Circuit granted a stay pending appeal and ordered an expedited en banc consideration on the merits. \t\n2025-06-10\n\n\nTrade LawExecutive Action: TariffsState of California v. Trump (D.N.D. Cali)\n\nCase No. 3:25-cv-03372 Complaint2025-04-16Overview:  The State of California brought suit against President Donald Trump and his administration, challenging various Executive Orders that implement tariffs purportedly authorized by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). California alleged that the imposition of across-the-board tariffs is not authorized under the IEEPA, and is a violation of the Separation of Powers. The State of California requested that the court block the Agency Defendants from implementing or enforcing the IEEPA Executive Orders. On June 2, the Court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction, which plaintiffs have appealed.\nCase Summary: On February 1, 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 14193 (Imposing Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across our Northern Border), and on Apr. 2, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 14257 (the \u201cLiberation Day Order\u201d). Together, these Executive Orders impose a broad tariff regime on imports from countries around the world. Plaintiffs California Governor Gavin Newsom and the State of California brought suit alleging that the President does not have authority to impose the tariffs outlined in the Executive Orders. California claims that the tariffs will create substantial economic harm to the state in various forms, including lost tax revenue and impacts to the State\u2019s ability to import and export goods.\nCalifornia alleges that the President lacks authority to impose the tariffs described by the Executive Orders. California argues that the power to levy tariffs is exclusive to Congress, and that Congress can and has delegated this authority to the executive branch via statute. The Executive Orders invoked the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) as the source of authority for the tariffs. However, California alleges that the IEEPA confers only limited authority to the President, and that it does not provide the President with authority to impose tariffs. Instead, California argues that other statutes grant the President authority to levy tariffs, but that those statutes require substantial process and congressional participation, which did not occur in this instance. The State brought two counts, arguing that the tariffs are ultra vires and a violation of the Separation of Powers. California has asked the court to declare the tariffs unlawful and void, and to enjoin Defendants from taking any action to implement the Executive Orders.\n\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 17, the Defendants filed a motion to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade, claiming that that court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear civil actions challenging the imposition of tariffs. \nUpdate 2: On May 1, the Plaintiffs filed their opposition to the Defendants\u2019 motion to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade, claiming that the current court has jurisdiction to decide the lawsuit because the action does not arise out of a law providing for tariffs.\nUpdate 3: On May 8, Defendants replied in support of their motion to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade.\nUpdate 4: On May 13, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, requesting that the court restrain Agency Defendants from implementing or enforcing the IEEPA Tariff EOs.\nUpdate 5: On June 2, the court issued an order denying the government\u2019s motion to transfer and dismissed the case without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.\nUpdate 6: On June 2, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Ninth Circuit.2025-06-02\n\n\nTrade LawExecutive Action: TariffsBarnes v.

The government moved to dismiss the suit, which the court granted.\nCase Summary: On Feb. 1, 2025, Trump issued Executive Orders imposing a 25% tariff on products imported from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on products imported from China. The pro se Plaintiff, a private citizen who alleges the tariffs will affect his standard of living, sued Trump arguing that the tariffs were unconstitutional because the president does not have constitutional authority to impose tariffs. The Plaintiff also alleges that Congress unconstitutionally delegated to the Executive Branch its authority under Article I, Sections 7 and 8 of the Constitution. The Plaintiff seeks a ruling that the president does not have constitutional authority or jurisdiction to import tariffs on foreign products as well as preliminary and permanent injunction to suspend the tariffs. \nUpdate 1: On Mar. 21, the government filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Plaintiff lacks standing.  Plaintiff filed a reply in response to the motion to dismiss on Apr. 22.\nUpdate 2: On May 9, the government replied in support of its motion to dismiss.\nUpdate 3: On May 23, the court dismissed the case finding that the Plaintiff lacked standing to sue\u2014i.e. he did not show the tariffs caused him personal harm.

On May 29, the district court granted a temporary hold to the tariffs.\nCase Summary: Since Feb. 1, 2025, Trump has used Executive Orders to impose tariffs on products from several countries, including a 25% tariff on products imported from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on products imported from China. Plaintiffs, family-owned businesses whose products will be impacted by the tariffs, sued Trump, alleging that the EOs exceed the authority delegated to the President in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), violate the Administrative Procedure Act, and are an unconstitutional violation of separation of powers. They seek declaratory judgment that the administration\u2019s actions are unlawful and unconstitutional, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against implementing the tariff EOs.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 24, the Trump administration moved to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade. On that same day, Plaintiffs\u2019 filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the Agency Defendants from taking any action to implement or enforce the tariff EOs and their amendments against Plaintiffs.\nUpdate 2: On May 1, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction. Defendants assert that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and that the issue of Trump\u2019s tariffs under the IEEPA is a political question because Congress lawfully delegated authority to the President to regulate importation through the imposition of tariffs under special circumstances.\nUpdate 3: On May 7, Plaintiffs filed their opposition to the Trump Administration's motion to transfer, noting that the U.S. Court of International Trade has heard zero cases arising out of IEEPA since the IEEPA\u2019s enactment.\nOn that same day, Plaintiffs replied in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 4: On May 29, the district court granted a preliminary injunction.2025-05-29\n\n\nTrade LawExecutive Action: TariffsOregon v.

Twelve states sued Trump, arguing that Trump\u2019s orders are an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers, that the agencies implementing the tariffs have no statutory authority to do so, and that the administration\u2019s actions are arbitrary and capricious and therefore violate the Administrative Procedure Act. They seek declarations that the EOs and agency guidance implementing the EOs are unlawful and preliminary and permanent injunctions against implementation of the EOs and agency guidance.\nUpdate 1: On May 7, the Plaintiff States filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to block the Department of Homeland Security (DOH) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection from implementing the EOs and imposing any tariffs pursuant to those orders.\nUpdate 2: On May 8, Judge Gary Katzmann ordered that Plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction motion be construed as a motion for summary judgment.\nUpdate 3: On May 12, Defendants filed a brief in response to Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment.

S. human rights advocates who have advised and supported the International Criminal Court (ICC) are challenging an Executive Order (EO) imposing sanctions on the ICC, claiming that the sanctions violate their First Amendment rights to provide legal advice and evidence to the ICC.E\n\nCase Summary: On February 6, 2025 President Trump issued EO 14203, \u201cImposing Sanctions on the International Criminal Court\u201d, which imposed economic and travel sanctions against the ICC\u2019s Prosecutor and head of the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) Karim Khan, under the authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The EO prohibits all US citizens, permanent residents and companies from providing him with services and material support, on pain of significant civil and criminal penalties.\nPlaintiffs are two U.S. citizens who have advised and supported the ICC and the OTP in their capacity as human rights advocates. They allege that their work with the OTP to carry out its investigative and prosecutorial mandate is speech protected by the First Amendment, and that the speech restrictions imposed by the EO violate their First Amendment rights because they have been forced to stop working with the OTP due to the threat of criminal prosecution and civil fines. They also argue that the EO is an ultra vires action in violation of the IEEPA because Congress specifically denied the President under the IEEPA the authority to regulate or prohibit the importation or exportation of any \u201cinformation or informational materials.\u201d50 U.S.C. \u00a71702 (b)(3).\nPlaintiffs have asked for a declaratory judgement  that the EO violates the First Amendment, and does not comply with the requirements of the IEEPA, and for an injunction to prevent the government from implementing or enforcing the speech restrictions in the EO.\nUpdate 1: On Apr. 25, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction requesting that the court prohibit Defendants from imposing civil or criminal penalties on them under the EO and the IEEPA based on their provision of speech-based services to the OTP.2025-04-25\n\n\nInternational InstitutionsExecutive Action: Actions toward International Criminal Court (Executive Order - 14203 Imposing Sanctions on the International Criminal Court)Rona v.

The EO prohibits all US citizens, permanent residents, and companies from providing him with services and material support, on pain of significant civil and criminal penalties.\nPlaintiffs are two U.S. citizens who are law professors who have advised and interacted with ICC and the OTP. Plaintiff Davis was appointed as a Special Advisor to Khan in December 2024, and Plaintiff Rona filed a complaint against the Trump Administration during Trump\u2019s first term following the release of EO 13928, which was materially identical to EO 14203 but was ultimately rescinded. Plaintiffs now allege that their work with the OTP is speech protected by the First Amendment, and that the speech restrictions imposed by EO 14203 violate their First Amendment rights because they have been forced to stop working with the OTP due to the threat of criminal prosecution and civil fines. They assert that this EO is in violation of their Fifth Amendment right to Due Process because it provides no notice to Plaintiffs as to what acts are prohibited and permits the arbitrary enforcement of the EO. Plaintiffs also argue that the EO is an ultra vires action in violation of the IEEPA because Congress specifically denied the President the authority to regulate or prohibit the importation or exportation of \u201cany information or informational materials\u201d under the IEEPA. 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702(b)(3).\nPlaintiffs have asked for a declaratory judgment that the EO violates the First and Fifth Amendments, and does not comply with the requirements of the IEEPA, and for an injunction to prevent the government from implementing or enforcing the EO\u2019s speech restrictions. Immediately after submitting their initial complaint, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction.\nUpdate 1: On May 13, Defendants filed their opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 preliminary injunction motion.2025-05-13\n\n\nInternational InstitutionsExecutive Action: Actions toward International Criminal Court (Executive Order - 14203 Imposing Sanctions on the International Criminal Court)Iverson v. Trump\n\nCase No. (1:25-cv-01353)Complaint2025-05-05Overview:  A U.S. citizen who is the lead prosecutor for cases in the International Criminal Court (ICC) against individuals involved with mass atrocities in Darfur is challenging an Executive Order (EO) imposing sanctions on the ICC and the head of the ICC Office of the Prosecutor (OTP). He asserts that the sanctions impose overbroad sanctions that prevent him from conducting his work and violate his First Amendment right to provide legal advice and evidence, as well as exceeding the statutory limits that Congress has imposed on the President\u2019s use of sanctions. This case was voluntarily dismissed on May 13. \nCase Summary: On February 6, 2025, President Trump issued EO 14203, \u201cImposing Sanctions on the International Criminal Court,\u201d which stated that \u201cany effort by the ICC to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute protected persons\u201d constitutes a threat to the national security of the United States. The EO authorized blocking sanctions to counter any ICC actions against protected persons, defined as a national of the US, Israel or any other \u201cally of the United States\u201d, which is in turn defined as a \u201cmajor non-NATO ally\u201d (MNNA).  In addition, the EO designated Karim Khan, the Prosecutor and head of the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the ICC, a Specially Designated National (SDN) and thus subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The EO prohibits all US citizens, permanent residents, and companies from providing a SDN with services and material support, directly or indirectly, on pain of significant civil and criminal penalties.\nPlaintiff is a U.S. citizen and attorney who has been a prosecutor in the ICC since 2010. He is presently the lead prosecutor in cases supported by the United States against individuals accused of committing war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region of Sudan. Plaintiff alleges that although he does not work on any investigation involving protected persons or a MNNA, the EO and the designation of the ICC as an SDN directly impairs, if not totally prohibits, him from engaging in the practice of law and exercising his professional duties as a prosecutor in the OTP. He asserts that there is a non-speculative risk that activities necessary for him to conduct investigations and build cases for the OCD will be deemed the provision of prohibited services to an SDN and the receiving of material benefits from an SDN.\nPlaintiff alleges that his work with the OTP is speech protected by the First Amendment, and that the speech restrictions imposed by the EO violate his First Amendment rights because he is unable to do his work with the OTP due to the threat of criminal prosecution and civil fines. Plaintiff also argues that the EO violates provisions of the IEEPA because Congress specifically denied the President the authority to regulate or prohibit the importation or exportation of \u201cany information or informational materials\u201d under the IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702(b). He further contends that the IEEPA explicitly requires that sanctions only be invoked in connection with a \u201cnew threat\u201d to the U.S., 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701(b), which Plaintiff alleges is not the case. He asserts that the EO is overbroad and in conflict with legislation by Congress authorizing the provision of direct support to the ICC in connection with its activities, including on cases involving Darfur. \nThe Plaintiff has asked for a declaratory judgment that the EO violates the First Amendment and does not comply with the requirements of the IEEPA, and for a judgement enjoining the Defendants from commencing or authorizing any prosecution or civil enforcement against him in relation to his work on Darfur.\nUpdate 1: Immediately following the filing of his complaint on May 5, the Plaintiff filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) as well as a motion for a preliminary injunction and supporting memorandum. Plaintiff requested that the court issue an order prohibiting Defendants from imposing civil or criminal penalties on him under the EO.\nUpdate 2: On May 13, the Plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case. Judge Christopher Cooper ordered the dismissal that same day.2025-05-13\n\n\nMiscellaneousExecutive Action: Border EnforcementValuta Corporation, Inc. v. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (W.D. Tex.)\n\nCase No. 3:25-cv-00191Complaint2025-05-30Overview:  On May 30, 2025, Plaintiffs Valuta Corporation, Inc., and Payan\u2019s Fuel Center, Inc. filed suit against the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the US Department of the Treasury (\u201cthe Treasury\u201d). Plaintiffs alleged that FinCEN\u2019s order from March 2025, which imposed reporting requirements on money services businesses operating near the US-Mexico border, violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and exceeded FinCEN\u2019s statutory authority. The Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, which Judge Schydlower granted on June 24, 2025, noting that the order likely violates the APA. \nCase Summary: In March 2025, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a Geographic Targeting Order with the stated purpose of combatting illicit activity at the US-Mexico border. The order articulated that Money Services Businesses (MSBs) operating within 30 designated zip codes near the border are required to file Currency Transaction Reports for cash transactions exceeding $200.  On May 30, 2025, Plaintiffs Valuta Corporation, Inc., and Payan\u2019s Fuel Center, Inc. filed suit against Defendants, claiming that this order violates the Fourth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act.\nUpdate 1: On May 30, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order. \nUpdate 2: On June 9, 2025, Defendants filed an opposition to Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order. \nUpdate 3: On June 10, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a reply to Defendants\u2019 opposition to their motion for a temporary restraining order. \nUpdate 4: On June 24, 2025, Judge Schydlower granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order, barring the administration\u2019s enforcement of the Geographic Targeting Order and noting that the order likely violates the Administrative Procedure Act and that the government failed to address key problems, such as the ease of circumventing the order by crossing the street and the disproportionate burden on small businesses.2025-06-24\n\n\n",

    "content": "\n Fifth Amendment: No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\n \u201cThe  Fifth Amendment to the Constitution says \u2018nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\u2019 This is a tacit recognition of a preexisting power to take private property for public use, rather than a grant of new power.\u201d   Eminent domain  \u201cappertains to every independent government. It requires no constitutional recognition; it is an attribute of sovereignty.\u201d   In the early years of the nation the federal power of eminent domain lay dormant as to property outside the District of Columbia,  and it was not until 1876 that its existence was recognized by the Supreme Court. In Kohl v. United States  any doubts were laid to rest, as the Court affirmed that the power was as necessary to the existence of the National Government as it was to the existence of any state. The federal power of eminent domain is, of course, limited by the grants of power in the Constitution, so that property may only be taken for the effectuation of a granted power,  but once this is conceded the ambit of national powers is so wide-ranging that vast numbers of objects may be effected.  This prerogative of the National Government can neither be enlarged nor diminished by a state.  Whenever lands in a state are needed for a public purpose, Congress may authorize that they be taken, either by proceedings in the courts of the state, with its consent, or by proceedings in the courts of the United States, with or without any consent or concurrent act of the state. \n \u201cPrior to the adoption of the  Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d  the power of eminent domain of state governments  \u201cwas unrestrained by any federal authority.\u201d   The Just Compensation Clause of the  Fifth Amendment did not apply to the states,  and at first the contention that the Due Process Clause of the  Fourteenth Amendment afforded property owners the same measure of protection against the states as the  Fifth Amendment did against the Federal Government was rejected.  However, within a decade the Court rejected the opposing argument that the amount of compensation to be awarded in a state eminent domain case is solely a matter of local law. On the contrary, the Court ruled, although a state  \u201clegislature may prescribe a form of procedure to be observed in the taking of private property for public use, . . . it is not due process of law if provision be not made for compensation. . . . The mere form of the proceeding instituted against the owner . . . cannot convert the process used into due process of law, if the necessary result be to deprive him of his property without compensation.\u201d   Although the guarantees of just compensation flow from two different sources, the standards used by the Court in dealing with the issues appear to be identical, and both federal and state cases will be dealt with herein without expressly continuing to recognize the two different bases for the rulings.\nThe power of eminent domain is inherent in government and may be exercised only through legislation or legislative delegation. Although such delegation is usually to another governmental body, it may also be to private corporations, such as public utilities, railroad companies, or bridge companies, when they are promoting a valid public purpose. \n\n",

    "title": "Washington governor signs rent control into law | Multifamily Dive",
    "content": "\nWashington Gov. Bob Ferguson signed a bill on May 7 restricting rent increases in the state, joining California and Oregon as the third state, plus the District of Columbia, to institute rent control.\nHB 1217, in its final form, restricts rent increases for existing tenants in Washington state to 7% per year plus inflation or 10%, whichever is lower. Rents for new tenants may be adjusted to any amount, according to a news release from the governor\u2019s office. Rent increases for manufactured homes have been further limited to 5% per year.\n\u201cAt a time of economic uncertainty, this common sense guardrail will protect working families and seniors from excessive rent hikes,\u201d said State Senator Emily Alvarado, a Democrat representing West Seattle, who originally introduced the bill as a member of the House, in the release.\nThe law exempts new construction for 12 years, as well as affordable housing managed by nonprofit organizations and public housing authorities, according to a news release from Alvarado. The caps are designed to sunset after 15 years, except for the 5% cap on manufactured home rents, which is permanent. Landlords must provide 90 days\u2019 minimum written notice of a rent increase.\nIntroduced in January, the bill passed the House on March 10. In the Senate, the bill was amended to raise the rent cap to 10% plus inflation and to exempt single-family rental homes. These amendments were removed in a conference committee on April 27, and the final passage vote in the House was 54 to 44 with five Democrats joining the Republican opposition, according to AP.\nHB 1217 was part of a package of housing-focused bills signed by Ferguson in the same session. The others include:\u00a0\n\nHB 1516, which creates additional insurance options for condominiums.\nHB 1757, which requires cities to create rules for multifamily conversions.\u00a0\nSB 5184, which limits the number of parking spaces cities and counties can require for housing.\u00a0\nSB 5313, which expands the items that are prohibited in residential rental agreements.\nSB 5529, which expands affordable housing tax incentives.\u00a0\nSB 5611, which reduces housing permit timelines.\n\n\u201cWashington needs more affordable housing \u2014 a lot more,\u201d Ferguson, a Democrat, said in his release.\u00a0 \u201cWe must make it easier, faster and less expensive to build housing of all kinds. These bills will address this pressing need.\u201d\nExpanding control\nWashington\u2019s rent control legislation is the first to pass at the state level in six years, following California\u2019s and Oregon\u2019s rent control laws in 2019.\u00a0\n\nMajor municipalities with rent control include New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and St. Paul, Minnesota. St. Paul recently amended its existing rent control ordinance, creating a permanent exemption for any units that received a certificate of occupancy after Dec. 31, 2004, according to local news outlet KSTP.\nMultifamily groups, including the National Apartment Association and National Multifamily Housing Coalition, have long opposed rent control in any capacity, saying that the laws exacerbate housing shortages and lead to the deterioration of existing buildings.\u00a0\nThe Renton, Washington-based Washington Multi-Family Housing Association said that the law\u2019s signing was deeply disappointing and sends the wrong message to the state\u2019s housing providers.\u00a0\n\u201cThis bill adds new regulatory uncertainty at a time when the industry is already grappling with rising costs, labor shortages and shifting economic conditions,\u201d the organization said in a statement shared with Multifamily Dive. \u201cOur members want to be part of the solution to Washington\u2019s housing crisis. But laws like HB 1217 make it harder to continue operating here, and harder to attract capital.\u201d\nJay Parsons, independent consultant and former chief economist at Richardson, Texas-based RealPage, noted that while most renewal rent increases are already in the 7% to 10% range, Washington\u2019s rent control law sets a precedent for future restrictions.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this elsewhere in places like New York, [where] they\u2019ve expanded or revised the rent control rules\u2026four different times,\u201d Parsons told Multifamily Dive before the law was signed. \u201cSo I think that the precedent is going to likely lead some developers and investors to maybe not consider the state of Washington. Not everybody\u2019s going to do that, but I think there\u2019ll be others who\u2019ll say, \u2018We don\u2019t want to mess with it.\u2019 It definitely adds a lot of risks to future investments.\u201d\n\n",

    "title": "What exemptions apply to AB 1482, California\u2019s rent-control law? | Mynd Management",
    "content": "On October 7, 2019, California governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 1482 (AB 1482), the California Tenant Protection Act of 2019, to give Golden State residents some relief from soaring rents and home prices by instituting rent control.\u00a0For the majority of California's multifamily housing stock, AB 1482 caps annual rent increases at 5 percent plus the rate of inflation, or 10 percent, whichever is lower.\u00a0The rent control law also requires a property owner to have \u201cjust cause\u201d to evict a tenant. But there are AB 1482 exemptions.AB 1482 affects about 2.4 million homes and apartments and is in force until 2030.When Newsom signed the Tenant Protection Act, the Covid-19 pandemic was still five months away from hitting in force. And in the last two and a half years, home prices and rents have continued to rise.\u00a0As of March, Los Angeles's median home price was about $920,000; in\u00a0San Francisco, that figure was $1.5 million. In a survey conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California, some 55 percent of Californians were concerned they would be unable to make their rent or mortgage payments this year.\u00a0With the signing of AB 1482, California became the second state in the union, after Oregon, to establish statewide rent control. The California Apartment Association called it \u201cthe most significant policy change for California's rental housing owners and tenants in a quarter century.\u201dWhat types of housing are exempted from both the rent cap and just cause limitations?Rentals state-wide are covered, but there are some AB 1482 exemptions. Some are exempt from both the rent cap and the just-cause limitations:Units constructed in the last 15 years are exempt (on a rolling basis, i.e., a unit constructed on January 1, 2008 is not covered as of January, 1 2023, but is covered on and after January 1, 2023).Units are exempt if they are restricted to be affordable for low- or moderate-income residents.A single family home is exempt unless it's owned by a real estate investment trust (REIT), a corporation, or an LLC where one of the members is a corporation. The owner must inform the renter in writing that the tenancy is not subject to the rent cap and just cause limitations.Duplexes and other two-unit properties are exempt if one unit is occupied by the owner.Some dormitories are exempt.The exemption for single family residences does not apply if there is more than one dwelling unit on the same lot, or if there is an\u00a0additional dwelling unit\u00a0in the building that cannot be sold separately (such as an in-law unit).\u00a0What are some just causes to evict tenants?All of the following would qualify as a just cause to\u00a0evict a renter\u00a0under the Tenant Protection Act:\u00a0Nonpayment of rent.\u00a0A breach of the material term of the lease.Nuisance, waste, unlawful, or criminal activity.Refusal to sign a written extension or renewal of the lease.Assigning or subletting.Refusal to allow the owner to enter the unit.The owner moving themselves or a family member into a unit.The owner substantially renovating.The owner going out of business.What rental property units are exempt from the just cause regulations?Rental properties that are already subject to a local ordinance that requires just cause to terminate a tenancy and is more protective than state law.Single family, owner-occupied residences where the owner rents no more than two bedrooms or units, including accessory dwelling units and junior accessory dwelling units.Accommodations in which the tenant shares a bathroom or kitchen with the owner, if the owner uses the property as their principal residence.What are the provisions for eviction under AB 1482?Eviction provisions apply only after all tenants have lived in the unit for one year or more, or if at least one tenant has occupied the unit for two years.A tenancy may not be terminated without just cause, which must be stated in the termination notice.Some just cause reasons are categorized as at-fault, some as no-fault. In the case of no-fault evictions, relocation assistance is required.The mere expiration of a lease or rental agreement is not a just cause.What are the rent increase limits and exceptions?For units covered by the Tenant Protection Act, annual rent increases are limited to no more than 5 percent plus the percentage change in the cost of living for the region in which the property is located, or 10 percent, whichever is lower.For rent increases that take effect before August 1, the percentage change is calculated using the amount published for April (or March, if no amount is published for April) of the immediately preceding calendar year and April (or March) of the year before that.For rent increases taking effect on or after August 1, the percentage change is calculated using the amount published for April (or March, if no amount is published for April) of that calendar year and April (or March) of the immediately preceding calendar year.The percentage change must be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of one percent.No more than two increases are allowed in any 12-month period, and the total increase cannot exceed the 5 percent plus CPI cap.The total rent paid by subtenants to a master tenant cannot exceed the rent charged by the owner.There is no limit on the initial rent charged for a vacant unit.How must property owners communicate with tenants?Property owners must inform residents in any unit covered by the state law of the rent control and just cause laws. Any resident moving in after July 1, 2020 must be informed in an addendum to the lease or rental agreement or in a written notice signed by the resident, and they must receive a copy.\u00a0The notice language must read:California law limits the amount your rent can be increased. See Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code for more information. California law also provides that after all of the tenants have continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 12 months or more or at least one of the tenants has continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 24 months or more, a landlord must provide a statement of cause in any notice to terminate a tenancy. See Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code for more information.An owner claiming an exemption because the property is a single family home or condominium must provide a written notice to the resident.\u00a0For any tenancy commenced or renewed on or after July 1, 2020, this notice must be provided in the rental agreement.\u00a0If the owner does not provide the required notice, then a single family home or condominium is not exempt from the just cause or rent cap regulations.\u00a0The notice language must read:This property is not subject to the rent limits imposed by Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code and is not subject to the just cause requirements of Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code. This property meets the requirements of Sections 1947.12 (d)(5) and 1946.2 (e)(8) of the Civil Code and the owner is not any of the following: (1) a real estate investment trust, as defined by Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code; (2) a corporation; or (3) a limited liability company in which at least one member is a corporation.How are violations of AB 1482 enforced?\u00a0AB 1482 can be enforced only in state court. While no penalties are listed in the law itself, residents can sue for damages for wrongful eviction or unlawful business practices based on violations of AB 1482.",

    "content": "\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 \n \u00a0\u00a0\nby Carole Levitt, J.D., M.L.S.\nAfter 15 years of anticipation and demonstrations of online databases in beta-test, it has finally happened. The Los Angeles Daily Journal (and indeed all of the Daily Journal Corporation's California Newspapers and most of its other products) is now online at http://www.dailyjournal.com.\n\nOther legal newspapers were online since the 80's: In 1985, after relocating to Los Angeles (from Chicago) to take a position as a law librarian at Pepperdine University School of Law, one of the first online resources that I looked for was the local legal newspaper, the Los Angeles Daily Journal (DJ). In Chicago, I was used to accessing the city's daily legal newspaper online via Lexis. However, I soon learned that the Los Angeles legal newspaper was not available via Lexis. Instead, the DJ had a plan in place to create a searchable database of its own.\n\nSo I waited for the online DJ. Some years later, I saw a demonstration of the Daily Journal's proposed dial-in service (pre-Internet). So I waited. Then, in late 1999 I was invited to a demonstration of a web-based Los Angeles Daily Journal that was supposed to be available to the legal community in Spring 2000. So, I waited. Then it was postponed until summer 2000. So, I waited.\nThen it was coming in fall 2000. In fact, while I was at the Daily Journal/Glasser Legal Works Conference in October 2000, I saw a demonstration of the DJ's online site, now known as the perennially \u201ccoming soon\u201d service. I even knew librarians who were actually using it in San Diego (where it had been in beta test). So I waited.\nOn Monday, December 4, I knew the waiting was finally over. Near the bottom of the DJ's front page, I noticed a small article under the inauspicious headline \u201cWebsite goes online.\" With so many web sites being added to the web on a daily basis, I nearly skipped over the story, thinking it was just another web site and not THE web site that the Los Angeles legal community has been waiting for. If I had not been anticipating the launch of the Daily Journal's web site, I might have missed the story altogether. This was the announcement that the DJ had officially entered the digital age? The next day, when I recovered from the shock, I tested out the site in order to write this review.\nBut, first you need to register: The DJ sent letters to all print subscribers of the newspaper to inform them of the site's existence and the need to obtain passwords. (See the \u201cNote to Readers\u201d below) Passwords were then mailed to each subscriber who took the time to register via postal mail, and then a brief online registration procedure was required. One password is issued for each subscription to the DJ newspaper. Subscribers to the print version of the DJ's Court Rules can also receive passwords, but only for access to the Court Rules section of the site.\nFree or Freely Accessible? While the online site has been touted as \u201cfree\u201d to those who pay for a subscription to the print newspaper, it would be more accurate to say that it is freely accessible to print subscribers. Because there is no option for an online-only subscription, the print subscription charge may be considered by some as payment for access to the online site. And, print subscribers do not have a total free ride once they've gained access\u2014certain sections of the site are fee-based. There has been much confusion over this. For example, one has free access to the online Court Rules if one subscribes to the print Rules. On the other hand, there is no free access to the online \u201cJudicial Profiles\u201d even for print Judicial Profile subscribers. Even those (users and potential users with whom I spoke) who understand the need to charge still thought that the DJ's $15 per Profile was very high. Finally, subscribers to the print newspaper can search and view only selective current news articles free. To view a story from the archives the fee is $2. The charge did not seem too high to many librarians I spoke to, though they would have preferred free, or at least a pricing structure more in line with the Los Angeles Times' archives where any story up to 14 days old can be viewed and printed free (even by non-subscribers). Based on the confusion I encoutered in my conversations with researchers over these pricing and access structures, it is clear that the Daily Journal needs to do a better job of explaining its access and pricing policies.\nWarning: Charges Apply: In the fee-based sections, such as the \u201cVerdicts & Settlements\u201d section, a message to \u201cClick on case name to view case report\u201d also includes a warning that \u201cCharges apply when case report is viewed\u201d. But, the warning is at the bottom of the screen, and could easily be missed by someone who clicks to view a story at the top of the page. To avoid sticker shock when the invoice arrives, the warning should be prominent at the top of the page, in addition to the bottom.\nInitial reaction: Chock full of content. There's so much there, I immediately realized that this review would need to be written in two or three installments. While the site has excellent content, a fairly robust search engine, straightforward instructions about how to search each section of the site and clear notice about the date coverage of each of its sections, there were many aspects of the site that confounded me (more about that later). First let's take a look at the content:\nSite Content:\nThe following sections are accessible only to print newspaper subscribers and are also free of charge to them:\n\nThe Daily Journal newspaper - selective current articles and job ads only\nThe Daily Appellate Reporter (DAR) \u2013 current (last 3 days) and archives (back to 1997)\nCalifornia Appellate and Supreme Court cases - back to 1934, but one month behind\nCalifornia Codes\nCalifornia Legislation\nDirectory of Attorneys\n\nThe following online sections are accessible only to print newspaper subscribers but are NOT FREE OF CHARGE:\n\n\u201cResearch\u201d - which consists of \u201cNews Publications\u201d (the Daily Journal newspapers, special supplements such as Cyber Esq. and House Counsel and also the California Lawyer) - $2.00/Story\nSettlements & Verdicts - $3.00/Verdict\nJudicial Profiles - $15.00/Profile\n\nThe following online sections are accessible only to print Court Rules subscribers and are also free of charge to them:\nThe scope of the site's content confounded me. From a researcher's viewpoint (and I've been one for 23 years), it is incumbent upon a database provider to alert researchers to the scope of the database's coverage (both content and date). While the DJ clearly delineates the date coverage of its new database, it does not do the same with the scope of its content. After two days of intensely studying the site, I finally phoned the Project Manager, Sherri Salzman for illumination as to the scope of the site's content which was not clearly delineated anywhere on the site. Sherri immediately explained that the site should be regarded as \u201cadded value\u201d to the print version of the Los Angeles and San Francisco DJ, and not a mirror image of the print newspapers. In fact, it is a selective amalgamation of the Los Angeles DJ and the San Francisco DJ, with several other DJ products added to the mix - some free, some not.\nTo help other DJ researchers avoid the confusion I encountered, I have compiled the following information about the site's content coverage which is not listed anywhere on the site itself:\nThe most important information relating to content coverage is that the database is NOT comprehensive in its content coverage. It is comprised of selective stories only. There are a few rules of thumb that I can pass along to help you predict content coverage:\n\nAP stories found in the DJ print newspaper will never be found in the online DJ.\nEven stories from the print newspaper that are written by DJ staff writers do not necessarily make it into the online version. On Dec. 19, 2000, I searched the online Newswire for DJ staff writer Karen Coleman's \u201cDouglas Young Leads...\u201d story that I had read in the Dec. 19, 2000 print DJ earlier that day, but did not find it there. I also did not find it in the Research section.\nSome current stories are placed directly into the Research (archives) section, even though the Newswire section, which is where most current stories are found, is where one would expect to find the current story. Thus, if you don't find a current story in the \"Newswire\" section of the DJ, be sure to check the Research (archives) section. (The DJ considers the Research section more along the lines of a search engine rather than an archive.)\nBecause the online site is not a mirror image of the print newspaper, some sections from the print newspaper are not included in the online database, such as Legal Notices or the Calendar of Events.\nStaying with the \u201cnot a mirror image\u201d theme, story headlines and even lead sentences are sometimes changed when entered into the online database. This complicates online searching. For example, in the Dec. 19, 2000 print newspaper, the headline reads \"Child Advocates Sue to Improve State's Shelter\" while the database headline reads \"State Sued Over Shelter Conditions\". You'll need to avoid searching by the exact title used in the print story, and instead use a few keywords from the title or, better yet, from the body of the story.\nBecause the database is a selective amalgamation of the Los Angeles and San Francisco Daily Journals, one cannot search each newspaper separately.\n\nLack of standard search parameters between the different sections of the site may cause confusion: While punctuation is IGNORED when searching in the \u201cPublications\u201d section of the web site (which includes the Daily Journal, House Counsel, Cyber Esq. and California Lawyer), it is NOT ignored in the California Opinions, Codes, Constitution and Rules of Professional Conduct sections of the site. For example, a search for \u201chealth providers\u201d in the Publications part of the site will also bring up results that include \u201chealth provider's\u201d, but the same search run in the California Opinions section of the site would not bring up \u201chealth provider's\u201d. Another non-standard aspect of the site is the use of date restrictors. They can only be used in the \"Publications\" section of the site.\nNote To Readers: In attempts to include everyday experiences of Daily Journal web site users into this review, I called several law firm librarians for their opinion of the site. One librarian said, \u201cWhat site? I've been waiting all these years for the online Daily Journal and now that it's finally online, I didn't even know.\u201d I sensed resentment in her tone.\nAlthough the Daily Journal sent letters to all print subscribers, this librarian claimed not to have received one. The same goes for a law firm administrator in Pasadena who asserts that the print subscription is in her name, meaning that she too should have received the notice. Another firm librarian stated that she never received a return call about obtaining her password.\nAnd, when I finally did locate a law firm librarian who had seen the site, it turned out that she was referring to the beta site in San Diego and her only comment was \u201cThe DAR did not look comprehensive online\" (it is, I checked the online vs. the print DAR).\nTrack and bill back the cost of searches? We'll end Part I with the question that comes up most often: \u201cCan the searches be tracked by client and billed back?\u201d Yes. However, there does not appear to be a way to track the amount of time spent on each search, only the dollar amount spent on each search. To charge back searches, fill in the client name (or number) and the matter number in the box located at the top of the search screen, entitled \u201cSearch Title (optional)/Matter #\u201d. I found this awkwardly phrased and would suggest it be re-worded to say \u201cClient Name or Number\u201d / Matter Name or Number.\u201d\nPart II (coming in February): We'll take a look at the following sections of the DJ's site: Current News Publications, \u201cResearch (archives), the Current DAR, the DAR archives, California Cases (back to 1934).\nPart III (coming in March): We'll focus on the following sections: Court Forms (interactive), Court Rules, California Directory of Attorneys, Verdicts & Settlements, California Codes, California Legislation and Judicial Profiles.\n\n",

    "content": "\n\nby Carole Levitt, J.D., M.L.S.\nCurrent News Publications:\nView and print selective current stories free: Although subscribers cannot view or print a story free of charge in the \u201cResearch\u201d section (News Publications Archives), they can view and print selective current stories free by scanning the \u201cNewswire\u201d section. Click on one of the Newswire topics listed on the sidebar located on the left-hand side of the page. Topics range from \u201cTop Stories\u201d to \u201cReal Estate Law\u201d to \u201cFirm Watch\u201d to \u201cCalifornia Lawyer\u201d, to name a few.\n\u201cResearch\u201d:\nThe \u201cResearch\u201d section includes a search engine for the archives to all News Publications: To access the archives, click on \u201cResearch\u201d at the top of the home page. \u201cNews Publications\u201d include: the Daily Journal Newspapers (Los Angeles and San Francisco), Law Firm Articles, California Law Business, California Lawyer, House Counsel and Cyber Esq., all back to 1999 and Settlements & Verdicts (back to January 1998). (I was particularly thrilled to see Cyber Esq. listed because Internet For Lawyers was just profiled in the Dec. 8th issue, page 20. Remember though, you have to pay $2 to read it online.) And, note, as discussed in Part I, the archives are NOT comprehensive (they are not a mirror image of the print publications).\nSearch individually, or search \u201cAll\u201d. A specific publication, such as \u201cCyber Esq.\u201d, can be searched individually, or search \u201cAll News Publications\u201d simultaneously. I particularly like this feature.\nSearch by keyword and boolean connectors in the \u201cResearch\u201d section and use the date restrictors of \u201call\u201d, \u201cprevious year\u201d, \u201c6 months\u201d, \u201c3 months\u201d, or \u201c1 month\u201d.\nSave results: You may also \u201csave\u201d searches for an extended period of time and you may also view your results free for 24 hours.\nCurrent DAR Opinions:\nRead the last 3 days of opinions online or request a daily e-email: Note: If you read the DAR online on Dec. 12, it will be dated \u201cDec. 11\u201d, but don't assume it's a day behind the print edition. The online site posts the DAR a day earlier than the print edition. Subscribers can receive a daily DAR table of contents e-mailed to their in-box and can link to the full text of the opinion. While subscribers can forward the DAR table of contents e-mail to non-subscribers (with the Daily Journal's permission only), recipients cannot link to the full text of the case from the email. According to the online agreement, subscribers are not allowed to transmit anything from the DJ site to others, even including others in the same firm, without the express prior written consent of Daily Journal.\nDAR Archives (1997-):\nThe DAR has a fairly robust search engine (in contrast to the California case law database \u2013see below). The DAR search engine permits searching by case name, number, citation, topic (and sub-topic), court, keyword(s), attorney and judge. Curiously enough, there is no way to search the DAR by the DAR citation. I tried to search a DAR cite in the \u201cnumber\u201d field, the \u201ccitation\u201d field and finally in the \u201ckeyword(s)\u201d field. No luck.\nSearch by Topic: If searching the DAR by topic, don't click on \u201csub topic\u201d until you have first clicked on \u201ctopic\u201d. The sub-topics relating to each \u201ctopic\u201d do not get loaded into the drop down menu box until you first select the \u201ctopic\u201d.\nCalifornia cases (1934-):\nSearch engine: The California court opinions database (back to 1934) is provided by AccessLaw Inc. As noted above, the California court opinions search engine is more limited than the DAR search engine. At the California Court Opinions site, one is limited to searching by case name, citation (and not the DAR citation!!) and keyword(s) while the DAR section allows, in addition, attorney and judge name searching. This is curious. One would think the search engine would be standardized between sections of the web site, especially where the content is virtually the same. I'd venture to say that the search engine is less robust because it is provided by an outside source, and was not designed in-house by the Daily Journal as was the Daily Journal's own DAR proprietary database. Come to think of it, AccessLaw Inc. also provides FindLaw with its California cases and it too had the somewhat limited search capabilities until FindLaw recently enhanced the search engine.\nCurrency: The opinions are updated monthly. This contrasts sharply with the daily update one can find at the Court's own site and at FindLaw and LexisOne, all free sites by the way. I checked the currency of the sites on Dec. 19, 2000 by searching for cases about \u201cconstruction defect\u201d, \u201ctaxes\u201d and \u201cbad faith\u201d (words that were key issues in the Palm Valley Homeowners Assn. v. Design MTC case that I found available full text in the print DAR on Dec. 19, 2000). My search at the DJ/AccessLaw Opinions site did not find the Palm case, as I expected it would not. On the other hand, when I conducted the same search in the free FindLaw and the free LexisONEone database, the Palm Valley case did show as one of the results because these two sites add cases daily. Parallel sites for California cases are not provided at the DJ or the FindLaw site, but are provided at the Lexis site.\nNo \u201call courts\u201d search option: One must choose to search either the \u201cCalifornia Appellate\u201d cases or the \u201cCalifornia Supreme\u201d cases. I'd like to see an \u201call courts\u201d option.\nFeatures Common to the News, DAR and Opinions databases:\nPrinter Friendly or Email results: Results can be printed out in a \u201cprinter-friendly\u201d version (a clean copy without any extraneous text or pictures that are unrelated to the case or story) or can be emailed to someone else (or yourself). For a printer friendly version, click on \u201cprint\u201d at the top of the page (right side) instead of clicking on the browser's \u201cprint\u201d function.\nBoolean operators: Boolean operators may be used to connect keywords at the DJ site. Unfortunately, proximity connectors are not available. If you click on \u201chelp\u201d, a window pops up to show you the symbols to be used for the three boolean connectors. Except for the \u201cand\u201d operator which is the symbol \u201c&\u201d (just like Westlaw), the other symbols are rather non-intuitive. For the operator \u201cor\u201d, use the straight-line symbol \u201c|\u201d (by holding down \u201cshift\u201d). For the operator \u201cbut not\u201d, one must resort to using that hard to locate \u201ctilde\u201d symbol \u201c~\u201d (found in between the space bar and \u201cInsert\u201d -- at least on my keyboard).\nHelp screens: The usage of boolean operators in a search strategy is explained in the Site Instructions, but nowhere are you informed whether \"and\" or \"or\" is the default boolean operator. The answer is \"and\u201d. The\u201cboolean\u201d help pop up window would be more useful if it showed examples of how to structure a search using the boolean operator symbols. I could not decide if I was supposed to leave a space between the boolean operator symbols and the keywords. My intuition told me to leave a space. But, then again my intuition told me to use the minus sign \u201c-\u201d symbol for \u201cbut not\u201d until I clicked on \u201cboolean help\u201d and learned the symbol of choice was the tilde ~. So much for my intuition...So, I pondered, \u201cIs it \u201cRico ~ Puerto\u201d or \u201cRico~Puerto\u201d? Is it \u201cCivil Rico|Rico\u201d or Is it \u201cCivil Rico | Rico\u201d? Finally, I printed out and read the 14 page \u201cSite Instructions\u201d and there I found the examples that were sorely lacking at the DAR site. The answer: leave a space between boolean operator symbols and the keywords.\nKeyword(s) highlighted: If you search with keyword(s) in the case databases, they will be highlighted for you in the returned cases. But if you search by using the \u201cattorney\u201d or \u201cjudge\u201d search box, the search terms will not be highlighted. However, if you type the names into the \u201ckeyword(s)\u201d search box, their names will then be highlighted in the resulting cases.\nRefine, Expand and Save: You can \u201crefine\u201d the search (fill in more fields, or add more keywords), \u201csave\u201d it or \u201cexpand\u201d it (by re-running the search in the following databases: the DAR, Verdicts & Settlements, Profiles and the News Publications).\nPart III (coming in March): We'll focus on the following sections: Court Forms (interactive), Court Rules, California Directory of Attorneys, Verdicts & Settlements, California Codes, California Legislation and Judicial Profiles.\n\u00a0\n\n",

    "title": "NMHC | Rent Control vs. Rent Stabilization: A New Name for a Failed Concept",
    "content": "\nNearly all economists agree that rent control is a failed policy. In a 1990 survey of economists of the American Economic Association, fully 93 percent agreed that \u201ca ceiling on rents reduces the quality and quantity of housing available.\u201d[1] And among academics, it appears that this sentiment has not changed over time\u2014a 2012 survey conducted by the IGM Economics Experts Panel similarly found just 2 percent of economists who agreed that rent control \u201chad a positive impact over the past three decades on the amount and quality of broadly affordable rental housing\u201d (2 percent in this instance represented just one economist, who indicated they were not very confident in their response).\nThere is much-documented literature on the negative impacts of rent control. Some of the major findings of a 2018 literature on existing rent regulations by Dr. Lisa Sturtevant found include:\n\nRent control policies can hold rents of controlled units at a lower level but not under all circumstances.\nRent regulations do a poor job of targeting benefits for those who actually need them.\nRent regulations reduce the ability of owners to maintain their properties, resulting in blight in certain communities.\nRent control policies can lead to a reduction in the available supply of rental housing.\n\nDespite this agreement among economists and documented negative consequences, rent regulations that limit rent growth continue to be introduced throughout the country with increasing frequency. These laws vary in terminology when introduced, often characterized as \u201canti-gouging\u201d laws or \u201crent stabilization\u201d laws. Contemporary advocates of regulation argue that \u201crent stabilization\u201d laws are less restrictive than previous rent control policies because they allow for increases related to inflation, thus promoting renter stability and affordability without causing any of the negative side effects associated with an absolute ceiling on rents. Contemporary opponents of these new regulations argue that they simply use different terms to describe the same concept: rent control, a government cap on how much a private owner can charge. Made even more confusing is that these terms are often substituted for one another in the media.\nIn this Research Notes, we examine various \u201crent stabilization\u201d laws throughout the country, and how they have become more restrictive\u2014highlighting the purported difference between these rent regulations and original rent control. We also examine whether some of the established consequences of rent control are present in these rent regulations that purport to have more flexible, data-based ceilings on rents. Specifically, we look at the cases of rent stabilization in New York City, Washington, DC, California and Oregon and whether these laws have deviated from the theoretical rationale for rent stabilization over time.\u00a0\n\n[1] 1 R.M. Alston, J.R. Kearl, and M.B. Vaughan, \"Is There a Consensus Among Economists in the 1990s?\" American Economic Review, May 1992, 82, 203-9. The criticism of rent control is so universally shared by economists that rent control often is cited by textbook writers as a paradigm of the harm governmental interference can have on the operation of a competitive market. See, for example, P. Samuelson and W. Nordhaus, Economics p. 79 (14th edition, 1992).\nThe History of Rent Regulations in the United States\nThe original rent control laws were implemented prior to 1950, and effectively froze rents at their pre-regulation levels. New York City\u2019s rent control program is perhaps the most well-known program, and dates to the 1940s. It represents one the most restrictive rent regulations effective in the U.S. today. The law, which applies to apartment units built before 1947 and occupied continuously since 1971, limits rents to a \u201cMaximum Base Rent\u201d that is adjusted every two years to reflect changes in operating costs. The Housing Stability & Tenant Protection Act of 2019 placed even further restrictions on allowable rent increases in controlled units.\nThese rent controlled units, which today account for less than one percent of all New York City apartments, provide significant discounts to their occupants. In 2017, the median rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in New York City recorded a gross monthly rent of just $840, less than a third of that charged by the median market-rate one-bedroom ($2,555).[2]\nAnother iteration of rent regulation is often referred to as \u201crent stabilization\u201d or \u201canti-gouging laws\u201d\u2014these laws are less stringent than the original rent control laws but still maintain a level of government control over rents. The stated aim of many newer rent regulations is to promote stability and affordability for lower-income apartment residents without disincentivizing new development and investment in current units. For example, Oregon\u2019s 2019 rent stabilization law limits rent growth in controlled apartment units to inflation plus 7 percent. The law exempts apartments built within the last 14 years (a moving target as each year progresses) and allows for unrestricted rent growth in between tenants (vacancy decontrol).\nSome characteristics of these laws can include:\n\nInflation-based limit: rents in controlled units are allowed to increase in line with inflation plus some additional percentage;\nVacancy decontrol: rents are allowed to increase to market levels when a resident vacates a controlled unit; and\nExemptions for newer units: units built after a certain date are exempt from regulation.\n\n\n[2] NMHC tabulations of 2017 New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey microdata.\nWashington, DC\nTake the case of Washington, DC, for instance. The District\u2019s most current iteration of rent regulation, which took effect in 2006, caps rent increases by the lesser of inflation (Consumer Price Index) plus 2 percent or 10 percent. This means that if annual inflation reaches 11 percent, the most an owner can raise their rents is 10 percent. The law is not universal\u2014it exempts units in buildings with fewer than five units as well as those buildings built after 1975. DC\u2019s original rent regulation also allows for some degree of vacancy decontrol; owners can raise rents by a maximum of 10 percent in between tenants or up to 30 percent if there exists an identical unit in the building renting for that amount.\nEarlier this month, however, the DC Council passed legislation that will limit annual rent increases in stabilized units to 6 percent for the next two years (below the 8.9 percent that the rent stabilization law would have allowed this year). In essence, the new legislation has capped the amount of rent that can be charged to CPI only. And if a property owner\u2019s expenses were to rise above 6 percent, they would be unable to raise rents by a proportional amount to make up that difference in costs. This is significant since the Consumer Price Index (CPI) does not fully reflect important non-controllable cost of operating rental housing, such as state and local taxes, certain utility costs, and insurance. NMHC\u2019s 2023 State of Multifamily Risk Survey, for instance, found a 26% average increase in property insurance costs for respondents in the past year.\nThe rationale for the new rent cap was that DC rents experienced a spike in mid-2022 in the wake of the COVID pandemic. This legislation comes after a three-year period in which rents have not kept pace with inflation, however. Rents for professionally managed apartments tracked by RealPage rose by an average annual rate of just 2.9 percent between 1Q 2020 and 1Q 2023, while inflation averaged 5.2 percent per year, as measured by CPI. The legislation (like rent control) also makes no effort to distinguish between cost-burdened renter households and non-cost burdened households; a household with an income of $1,000,000 would be able to utilize one of these units the same as a household with an income of $50,000.\nNew York City\nNew York City\u2019s rent stabilization law has been in effect for decades longer than most of the newer rent regulations, enacted in 1969. The law generally applies to apartments built prior to 1974 that are not subject to rent control and that are in buildings with six or more units. New York City\u2019s law, unlike Washington DC\u2019s, does not provide apartment owners the automatic right to increase rents in line with inflation. Instead, allowable rent increases are determined by the New York City Rent Regulations Board every year.\nFurthermore, in 2019, New York\u2019s rent stabilization law was made even more restrictive with the passage of the Housing Stability & Tenant Protection Act. Some of the main ways the law was amended include:\n\nElimination of Vacancy Decontrol: prior to the 2019 law, owners were permitted to raise rents by up to 20% in stabilized units when a tenant vacated their unit.\nHigh Rent / High Income Deregulation: the 2019 law repealed the right of apartment owners to deregulate stabilized units if rents surpassed a certain threshold (when vacated) or when rents surpassed that threshold and occupant incomes reached a certain level (when occupied).\nRestrictions on Major Capital Improvements: prior to the 2019 law, owners were allowed to enact permanent rent increases for stabilized apartments\u2014capped at 6 percent per year\u2014for building-wide improvements. The 2019 law limited these increases to just 2 percent and made them temporary (they must be removed after 30 years).\n\nOn June 21, 2023, the Rent Guidelines Board approved 3 percent rent increases for one-year leases and, for two-year leases, a 2.75 percent increase in the first year and a 3.2 percent increase in the second. These increases were in contrast with data cited by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board consisting of an 8.1 percent rise in operating costs this year for buildings that contain rent stabilized apartments, a 7.7 percent rise in real estate taxes, a 19.9 percent rise in fuel costs and a 12.9 percent rise in the cost of insurance. When rents fail to keep pace with operating expenses, apartment operators become financially constrained and tend to defer important maintenance.\nThe Rent Guidelines Board\u2019s Chair acknowledged in his remarks announcing the rent increases that owner-operator costs were increasing more than the rent increases but cited the rent burdens of residents when announcing the new rents. Similar to the Washington, DC legislation, none of these changes do anything to impact the ability of a renter to afford a market-rate unit if they are not able to currently\u2014only through income growth would a renter be able to afford a market-rate unit of a certain price.\nCalifornia and Oregon\nIn 2019, both California and Oregon passed statewide rent regulations framed as rent stabilization laws. California\u2019s Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (effective January 2020) caps rent growth at the lesser of 5 percent plus inflation or 10 percent. Similar to the issue present in the other jurisdictions, if inflation was 11 percent, the housing provider would not be able to raise market rents by this amount. This is important in a jurisdiction such as California that is facing uncertain property expenses as insurance costs mount due the large number of natural disasters in the state. On the homeownership side, for example, Allstate and State Farm have completely stopped selling policies in California.\nOregon\u2019s law currently caps rent growth for multi-unit properties at 7 percent plus inflation. The maximum rent increase allowed under the current law would be 14.6 percent.\nIn both cases, the law is not universally applied. California\u2019s law allows for vacancy decontrol and exempts rental units built within the last 15 years as well as some condos, single-family homes and two-unit properties. Oregon\u2019s 2019 law similarly caps rent growth only for multi-unit properties older than 15 years.\nAfter just a few years, there have already been efforts in both states to make these laws more restrictive. In March, California State Senator Mar\u00eda Elena Durazo introduced Senate Bill 567, which, among other things, included a provision that would reduce the limit on rent increases to the lesser of just inflation or 5 percent (this provision has since been removed). Some California jurisdictions such as Santa Monica have introduced their own, more stringent caps as well.\nOregon is similarly considering legislation, through Senate Bill 611, that would lower the limit of rent increases in the state to the lesser of inflation plus 7 percent or 10 percent (the bill originally proposed lowering the cap to the lesser of 3 percent plus inflation or 8 percent).\nIn the cases of both California and Oregon, the existing and new legislation would create no new opportunities for funding for renters; there is no targeting for low-income residents. A household would still need to be able to afford the market-rate unit, and the only way for them to afford that unit beyond their current circumstance would be through income growth, either via subsidy or increased earnings.\u00a0\nConclusion\nDespite claims that \u201crent stabilization\u201d and \u201canti-gouging laws\u201d have less of an impact on housing providers, the same basic principles that apply to rent control exist for these regulations. These regulations are, in effect, the same failed policy with a new name. All impose a ceiling on how much rent a housing provider can charge for a rental unit without regard to the actual cost of maintain rental housing and do nothing to get at the root of the problem\u2014the lack of housing supply.\nAnd while some laws may claim to account for changes in expenses for the housing provider, the Oregon example shows that theoretical concepts are overshadowed by political realities. Inflation may be a factor cited in creating a law, but if inflation becomes elevated, policymakers will frequently attempt to institute a cap lower than inflation (if such a cap does not already exist). This will make it more difficult to make needed repairs to their property if rental income is not keeping up with the cost of goods, similar to an established negative result of original rent control.\nRent regulations framed as rent stabilization or anti-gouging laws also depend on a resident\u2019s ability to afford a market rent, just as with the original rent control. If a resident is unable to afford a market-rate unit one year, they will still be unable to afford that unit the next year without some sort of income growth. These rent regulations do nothing to address the needs of the most vulnerable of the population; no new units are added to the housing stock to create market rents to decline (as we are beginning to see in some Sun Belt markets) and no additional subsidy is being given to households to allow them to afford a market-rate unit that would otherwise be unattainable to them.\nFinally, these rent regulations also are not universally applied, just as with rent control. In Washington, DC, single-family rental units are exempt from these requirements, as well as some single-family rentals in California. The owners of these rental units do not have a cap on their rents, and in the event of a large increase in expenses, they would be able to capture that increase via an increase in rent.\nWhile newer forms of rent regulation may seem, at first glance, to present a less heavy-handed approach than the original rent control regulations, these examples make clear that there is not really much difference. With any form of rent regulation, the future income stream is even more uncertain, subjective, and likely political, making a property a less attractive investment for prospective buyers as well. In contrast, supply-side solutions that either lower market-rate rents via increased supply (such as those found in NMHC\u2019s Affordability Toolkit) or demand-side solutions that allow more residents access to market-rate units (such as Housing Choice Vouchers) are proven solutions that address the needs of both housing providers and residents.\n\nAbout Research Notes:\u00a0Published quarterly, Research Notes offers exclusive, in-depth analysis from NMHC's research team on topics of special interest to apartment industry professionals, from the demographics behind apartment demand to the effect of changing economic conditions on the multifamily industry.\n\nQuestions or comments on Research Notes should be directed to Chris Bruen, Sr. Director of Research, NMHC, at cbruen@nmhc.org.\n\n\n",

    "title": "Rent Stabilization",
    "content": "\n\nRent Stabilization in NYC\nRent stabilization is a form of rent regulation; it helps combat the City's housing crisis by making sure some units remain affordable. Almost half of all apartments in New York City are rent stabilized. Rent stabilized apartments are most often located in buildings containing 6 or more units, which were built before 1974. If you live in a rent stabilized unit, you are entitled to additional protections and rights, so it is important to know your status.\nRent control is another form of rent regulation which also limits the rent an owner may charge for an apartment and restricts the right of any owner to evict tenants. The vast majority of rent regulated units in NYC are rent stabilized, rather than rent controlled.\nDetermining Rent Stabilization\nHere are some things to look out for to figure out if your home is rent stabilized:\n\nIt may be written on your lease.\nYour rent amount might not be a round number (for example, your rent might be $2176.43 instead of $2100).\nRent stabilization is reflected in your apartment's rent history.\n\nRequesting Rent History\nProcess for checking rent history\nTo determine if your home is rent stabilized, or to prove that it is, you can check your lease or order your rent history. If your lease is unclear or you don't have one, order your rent history from the NYS Division of Housing and Community Renewal (HCR):\n\nOrder your rent history online\n\nFill out this form to request your rent history online\nUnder \"reason\" select \"Apartment rent history\" or \"Am I rent stabilized?\" : both will get you the same result!\nInclude your First and Last Name, Email Address (if you don't have an email address, write \"N/A\"), and Select the Building Address, including the unit/apartment and zip code\n\n\nContact HCR's Office of Rent Administration by emailing rentinfo@nyshcr.org\n\nWhen requesting a rent history via email, you must provide the full address including the apartment number.\n\n\nContact HCR's Office of Rent Administration by calling 833-499-0343\n\nTo request your rent history over the phone, listen for the menu option to request your rent history, and stay on the line.\nYou must provide the full address including the apartment number, but you do not need to provide your name or an email address.\n\n\n\nNote: You can only request a rent history for your address and your rent history will only be mailed to you directly.\nAfter submitting a request\n\nIf you indicated an email address in your initial request, you should receive a confirmation of your request via email\nIf the apartment is rent stabilized, you will receive the rent history in the mail (at the address you shared in your request). If your apartment is NOT rent stabilized, you will not receive anything in the mail.\n\nRent history documents can be difficult to understand, so we recommend that once you receive it, you contact the Tenant Support Unit by calling 311 and asking for the \"Tenant Helpline.\" We can help determine your stabilization status and check if you are being overcharged in rent.\nRent Increases in Rent Stabilized Homes\nThere is a legal limit to how much you can be charged in rent. Your rent can only be increased by a percentage that is decided on each year by the Rent Guidelines Board. If you believe you are being overcharged in rent, make a rent overcharge complaint with the NYS Department of Homes and Community Renewal. In the Spring of 2024, the Rent Guidelines Board decided on rent changes that apply to rent stabilized leases starting on or after October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025.\nUnder the current guidelines, rent stabilized apartment leases can include rent increases of up to the following percentages:\n\n\n\nLease Length\nIncrease\n\n\n\n\n\n1-year lease\n\n\n2.75% increase\n\n\n\n\n2-year lease\n\n\n5.25% increase\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Tenant Rights in Rent Stabilized Homes\n\nYou have the right to renew your lease. This protects you from being evicted because of an expired or nonexistent lease. You can choose between a 1 or 2-year lease. If your landlord does not provide you with a renewal lease, you can submit a complaint with the Office of Rent Administration. Contact the Tenant Support Unit for support.\nRent stabilized tenants have the right to a renewal lease containing the same terms as their original lease.\nThe Housing Stability & Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA) of 2019 established that tenants paying a preferential rent on or after June 14, 2019, will retain it as long as they continue to rent the property. Preferential rent is rent that is lower than the legal regulated rent for the apartment. Tenants with preferential rent will still see rent increases, but only by the percentages allowed by the Rent Guidelines Board.\nSince the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA) was passed, rent stabilized apartments remain rent stabilized regardless of how high the rent reaches (unless the building received a 421-a exemption).\nIf you live with certain family members in their rent stabilized unit, and they pass away or permanently leave the apartment, you may be able to take over the lease with \"succession rights.\"\nIf you are an older adult or have a disability, you might qualify to freeze your rent.

    "content": "\nOur country\u2019s history of housing discrimination created the current conditions in which low-income communities and communities of color disproportionately rent their homes, placing them at the whim of a largely unregulated market with few tenant protections. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly 10 million renter households in the U.S. were severely cost-burdened (paying more than 50 percent of their income on rent). In 2023, the minimum wage needed to afford a modest one-bedroom home at a fair market rate in the United States is $23.67 per hour. As rents have continued to skyrocket with inflation and other factors, the need for protections for tenants in privately owned residential properties has increased.\u00a0\nRent stabilization, sometimes referred to as rent control, is an effective yet underutilized tool to increase housing stability and affordability for current tenants. It works by protecting tenants from excessive rent hikes, usually by creating a predictable schedule for the maximum rent increase allowable each year while ensuring a fair return for landlords. It is a smart, proven policy that can immediately stabilize prices, halt rent gouging, and reduce the risk of displacement and homelessness while increasing housing security and affordability over the long term. By decreasing renter housing cost burden over time, rent stabilization leaves tenants with more money to spend on essential needs and in the local economy. The increased stability and affordability created by rent control also have positive consequences on mental and physical health, children\u2019s educational outcomes, and community stability.\u00a0\nRent controls were first implemented in the United States during World War I and World War II era in response to housing shortages and rent gouging, and then were implemented again in many cities in the 1960s and 1970s in response to a growing tenant movement concerned about civil rights and inflation.\nThe growth of rent stabilization in major cities created a backlash from the real estate industry, which worked diligently to fight its spread by initiating and supporting preemption policies across the country, in addition to undermining efforts through legislation like the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act. More recently, there has been renewed interest in rent stabilization from cities and states. Both California and Oregon passed statewide rent stabilization in 2019, New York strengthened its laws in 2020, and Saint Paul became the first city in the Midwest to enact rent stabilization in 2021.\u00a0\nWhat are we calling it?\u00a0\nMultiple terms are often used interchangeably to describe rent stabilization policies, including:\n\nRent regulations: a general term for policies that aim to make private rental housing more affordable to tenants, whether by limiting rent increases, setting maximum rents, establishing rules for determining fair rents, and/or subsidizing lower rents or smaller rent increases\nRent control: sometimes referred to as \u201cfirst-generation rent regulations\u201d, these are policies that strictly regulate rent increases through price ceilings\nRent stabilization: sometimes referred to as \u201csecond-generation rent regulations\u201d or \u201cmodern rent control\u201d, these are policies that restrict how much landlords are allowed to increase rent annually\nRent cap: the rate that landlords are allowed to increase annually, most often in the form of a percentage that can be paired with inflation\nRent freeze: policies that prohibit rent increases and/or strictly set maximum rents, usually for a short period of time such as during a public health emergency\u00a0\n\nSee Local Progress, USC Dornsife Program for Environmental and Regional Equity, the Center for Urban and Regional Affairs at the University of Minnesota, and the Right to the City Alliance for more resources on rent stabilization ordinances.\n\n",

    "title": "How a Secret Rent Algorithm Pushes Rents Higher - ProPublica",
    "content": "\n\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they\u2019re published.\n\n\nOn a summer day last year, a group of real estate tech executives gathered at a conference hall in Nashville to boast about one of their company\u2019s signature products: software that uses a mysterious algorithm to help landlords push the highest possible rents on tenants.\n\u201cNever before have we seen these numbers,\u201d said Jay Parsons, a vice president of RealPage, as conventiongoers wandered by. Apartment rents had recently shot up by as much as 14.5%, he said in a video touting the company\u2019s services. Turning to his colleague, Parsons asked: What role had the software played?\n\u201cI think it\u2019s driving it, quite honestly,\u201d answered Andrew Bowen, another RealPage executive. \u201cAs a property manager, very few of us would be willing to actually raise rents double digits within a single month by doing it manually.\u201d\nThe celebratory remarks were more than swagger. For years, RealPage has sold software that uses data analytics to suggest daily prices for open units. Property managers across the United States have gushed about how the company\u2019s algorithm boosts profits.\n\u201cThe beauty of YieldStar is that it pushes you to go places that you wouldn\u2019t have gone if you weren\u2019t using it,\u201d said Kortney Balas, director of revenue management at JVM Realty, referring to RealPage\u2019s software in a testimonial video on the company\u2019s website.\nThe nation\u2019s largest property management firm, Greystar, found that even in one downturn, its buildings using YieldStar \u201coutperformed their markets by 4.8%,\u201d a significant premium above competitors, RealPage said in materials on its website. Greystar uses RealPage\u2019s software to price tens of thousands of apartments.\nRealPage became the nation\u2019s dominant provider of such rent-setting software after federal regulators approved a controversial merger in 2017, a ProPublica investigation found, greatly expanding the company\u2019s influence over apartment prices. The move helped the Texas-based company push the client base for its array of real estate tech services past 31,700 customers.\nThe impact is stark in some markets.\nIn one neighborhood in Seattle, ProPublica found, 70% of apartments were overseen by just 10 property managers, every single one of which used pricing software sold by RealPage.\nTo arrive at a recommended rent, the software deploys an algorithm \u2014 a set of mathematical rules \u2014 to analyze a trove of data RealPage gathers from clients, including private information on what nearby competitors charge.\nFor tenants, the system upends the practice of negotiating with apartment building staff. RealPage discourages bargaining with renters and has even recommended that landlords in some cases accept a lower occupancy rate in order to raise rents and make more money.\nOne of the algorithm\u2019s developers told ProPublica that leasing agents had \u201ctoo much empathy\u201d compared to computer generated pricing.\nApartment managers can reject the software\u2019s suggestions, but as many as 90% are adopted, according to former RealPage employees.\nThe software\u2019s design and growing reach have raised questions among real estate and legal experts about whether RealPage has birthed a new kind of cartel that allows the nation\u2019s largest landlords to indirectly coordinate pricing, potentially in violation of federal law.\nExperts say RealPage and its clients invite scrutiny from antitrust enforcers for several reasons, including their use of private data on what competitors charge in rent. In particular, RealPage\u2019s creation of work groups that meet privately and include landlords who are otherwise rivals could be a red flag of potential collusion, a former federal prosecutor said.\nAt a minimum, critics said, the software\u2019s algorithm may be artificially inflating rents and stifling competition.\n\u201cMachines quickly learn the only way to win is to push prices above competitive levels,\u201d said University of Tennessee law professor Maurice Stucke, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division.\nRealPage acknowledged that it feeds its clients\u2019 internal rent data into its pricing software, giving landlords an aggregated, anonymous look at what their competitors nearby are charging. \nA company representative said in an email that RealPage \u201cuses aggregated market data from a variety of sources in a legally compliant manner.\u201d\nThe company noted that landlords who use employees to manually set prices \u201ctypically\u201d conduct phone surveys to check competitors\u2019 rents, which the company says could result in anti-competitive behavior.\n\u201cRealPage\u2019s revenue management solutions prioritize a property\u2019s own internal supply/demand dynamics over external factors such as competitors\u2019 rents,\u201d a company statement said, \u201cand therefore help eliminate the risk of collusion that could occur with manual pricing.\u201d\nThe statement said RealPage\u2019s software also helps prevent rents from reaching unaffordable levels because it detects drops in demand, like those that happen seasonally, and can respond to them by lowering rents.\nRealPage did not make Parsons, Bowen or the company\u2019s current CEO, Dana Jones, available for interviews. Balas and a Greystar representative declined to comment on the record about YieldStar. The National Multifamily Housing Council, an industry group, also declined to comment.\nProponents say the software is not distorting the market. RealPage\u2019s CEO told investors five years ago that the company wouldn\u2019t be big enough to harm competition even after the merger. The CEO of one of YieldStar\u2019s earliest users, Ric Campo of Camden Property Trust, told ProPublica that the apartment market in his company\u2019s home city alone is so big and diverse that \u201cit would be hard to argue there was some kind of price fixing.\u201d\nWhat role RealPage\u2019s software has played in soaring rents \u2014 which in the decade before the pandemic nearly doubled in some cities \u2014 is hard to discern. Inadequate new construction and the tight market for homebuyers have exacerbated an existing housing shortage.\nBut by RealPage\u2019s own admission, its algorithm is helping drive rents higher.\n\u201cFind out how YieldStar can help you outperform the market 3% to 7%,\u201d RealPage urges potential clients on its website. \nFew tenants know that such software, owned by a privately held company, has had a hand in rent increases across the country.\nIn Boston, renter Kaylee Hutchinson said she was puzzled when her landlord \u2014 unbeknownst to her, a RealPage client \u2014 told her days into the first pandemic lockdowns that her rent was going up. Building staff insisted that the market rate for her apartment was 6.5% higher than she was paying, despite her protests that people were fleeing the city.\n\n\n\nKaylee Hutchinson\u2019s landlord, who uses RealPage\u2019s pricing software, told her rent was going up at the start of the pandemic even as many people were fleeing the city.\n\nCredit: \n        Philip Keith, special to ProPublica\n    \n\n\nA few weeks later, she and her fianc\u00e9 saw a newly vacant unit in their building advertised online for less. One of their landlord\u2019s policies permitted moving to another unit owned by the company, so they did.\nHutchinson, who is an analyst for the police department, wondered if a computer algorithm was behind building staff\u2019s inflexibility. \u201cIt was pretty obvious they should have been dropping prices,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were digging their heels in.\u201d\nHutchinson said she watched apartments in her building sit vacant at prices that didn\u2019t make sense to her.\n \u201cA normal mom-and-pop landlord, they\u2019re worried about having a good tenant and protecting their interest in the agreement,\u201d Hutchinson said. \u201cThese companies, they\u2019ll just replace you.\u201d\n\n    The Origins of YieldStar\n\nOne of YieldStar\u2019s main architects was a business executive who had personal experience with an antitrust prosecution. \nA genial, self-described \u201cnumbers nerd,\u201d Jeffrey Roper was Alaska Airlines\u2019 director of revenue management when it and other major airlines began developing price-setting software in the 1980s.\nCompeting airlines began using common software to share planned routes and prices with each other before they became public. The technology helped head off price wars that would have lowered ticket prices, the Department of Justice said.\nThe department said the arrangement may have artificially inflated airfares, estimating the cost to consumers at more than a billion dollars between 1988 and 1992. The government eventually reached settlements or consent decrees for price fixing with eight airlines, including Alaska Airlines, all of which agreed to change how they used the technology.\nAt one point, federal agents removed a computer and documents from Roper\u2019s office at the airline. He said he and other creators of the software weren\u2019t aware of the antitrust implications. \u201cWe all got called up before the Department of Justice in the early 1980s because we were colluding,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had no idea.\u201d\nWhen Roper returned to the United States in the early 2000s after a stint in central and eastern Europe, he said, he discovered the apartment rental industry was so far behind technologically that it resembled the emerging markets he\u2019d just left.\nApartment managers were \u201cbasically pricing their product on a paper napkin,\u201d said Roper, who eventually formed his own company.\nOld computers and manual recordkeeping were mainstays of the industry. Leasing agents gauged how their buildings compared by calling up competitors. \u201cThis was just a ripe business,\u201d with lots of money and lots of opportunities for technological improvement, Roper said.\nRealPage hired Roper as its principal scientist in 2004 to improve software it had bought from Camden Property Trust, a large investor-backed owner and manager of apartment buildings.\nRoper quickly realized he required data \u2014 a lot of data \u2014 to get the algorithm working properly. He began building a \u201cmaster data warehouse\u201d that pulled in client data from other RealPage applications, such as those for leasing managers.\nA proof-of-concept version of the software had performed well in tests at townhouses Camden offered for rent in its home city of Houston.\nAt the time, the street behind Camden\u2019s townhouses was shut down while a grocery store was being built. Leasing staff wanted to discount rent for the townhouses because of the nuisance, said Kip Zacharias, who worked with Camden as a consultant.\nInstead, YieldStar suggested boosting rents. \u201cWe were like, \u2018Guys, just try it,\u2019\u201d Zacharias said.\nThe units ended up renting for significantly more than staff had expected, he said. \u201cThat was kind of the eureka moment,\u201d Zacharias said. \u201cIf you\u2019d listened to your gut, you would have lowered your price.\u201d\nThe practice of lowering rent to fill a vacancy was a reflex for many in the apartment industry. Letting units sit empty could be costly and nerve-wracking for leasing agents.\nSuch agents sometimes hesitated to push rents higher. Roper said they were often peers of the people they were renting to. \u201cWe said there\u2019s way too much empathy going on here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is one of the reasons we wanted to get pricing off-site.\u201d\nUnimpeded by human worries, YieldStar\u2019s price increases sometimes led to more tenants leaving.\nCamden\u2019s turnover rates increased about 15 percentage points in 2006 after it implemented YieldStar, Campo, the company\u2019s CEO, told a trade publication a few years later. But that wasn\u2019t a problem for the firm: Despite having to replace more renters, its revenue grew by 7.4%.\n\u201cThe net effect of driving revenue and pushing people out was $10 million in income,\u201d Campo said. \u201cI think that shows keeping the heads in the beds above all else is not always the best strategy.\u201d\n(Reminded of that quote, Campo told ProPublica it \u201csounds awful\u201d and doesn\u2019t reflect how he or Camden views renters today. \u201cWe fundamentally believe our customers are the most important part of our business,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not about pushing people out.\u201d)\nHiking rents at the same time benefited all landlords, the industry learned. \u201cA rising tide lifts all boats,\u201d one real estate executive and revenue management proponent told the industry publication Yield Pro in 2007.\nOne of the greatest threats to a landlord\u2019s profit, according to Roper and other executives, was other firms setting rents too low at nearby properties. \u201cIf you have idiots undervaluing, it costs the whole system,\u201d Roper said.\n\n\n\nJeffrey Roper helped develop YieldStar, which uses an algorithm to suggest prices for apartments across the country.\n\nCredit: \n        Shelby Tauber for ProPublica\n    \n\n\nRoper wasn\u2019t the only technologist working on an apartment pricing algorithm. Donald Davidoff, the primary developer of rival software called Lease Rent Options, or LRO, said he designed his program differently, to head off any concerns about collusion.\nInstead of relying on a digital warehouse that includes competitor data, Davidoff used a complex formula and public market data to steer LRO\u2019s algorithm. The system relied on incremental price shifts to manage demand for apartments, said Davidoff, an MIT-educated former rocket engineer. \u201cThat\u2019s not dissimilar to changing a trajectory of a rocket through inflection of a nozzle,\u201d he said \u2014 making small changes that can dramatically alter something\u2019s course over time.\nDavidoff said he was careful to avoid features that might run counter not only to anti-discrimination laws, such as the Fair Housing Act, but also those that bar competitors from conspiring to set prices.\n\u201cI had many conversations with attorneys to understand where the boundaries are,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody who\u2019s building one of these systems or is involved in these should care a lot about fair housing and should care a lot about price collusion to avoid both.\u201d\nRoper told ProPublica that when he was developing the YieldStar software more than a decade ago, he was concerned about avoiding both issues. He also said he didn\u2019t want to misuse private data in pricing.\n\u201cI was highly sensitized to: You just don\u2019t do it,\u201d Roper said.\nDespite differences in the software\u2019s design, RealPage acquired LRO in 2017 after months of scrutiny by the antitrust division of the justice department. Federal regulators review mergers above a certain size \u2014 right now, it is transactions valued at $101 million \u2014 and typically allow them to proceed after only a preliminary review. But some are flagged for a more extensive look. The government can challenge a merger in court if it believes it could substantially harm competition.\nRealPage\u2019s purchase of LRO received such a second look, but the DOJ allowed it to proceed in late 2017. The department did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe approval allowed RealPage to acquire its only significant competitor, Roper said, adding, \u201cI was surprised the DOJ let that go through.\u201d\nRealPage was pricing 1.5 million units, and the acquisition of LRO would double that, Steve Winn, RealPage\u2019s then-CEO, said at a mid-2017 investor conference. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any concentration, enough concentration, of buying or pricing power here\u201d to warrant DOJ concerns, he said. A third company had a substantial footprint in the market, Winn said, but property managers\u2019 own manual pricing processes or proprietary systems were RealPage\u2019s largest competitor.\n\u201cWe expect our combined platform to drive accelerated, sustained revenue growth,\u201d Winn said in a media release announcing the deal.\nRealPage\u2019s influence was burgeoning. That year, the firm\u2019s target market \u2014 multifamily buildings with five or more units \u2014 made up about 19 million of the nation\u2019s 45 million rental units. A growing share of those buildings were owned by firms backed by Wall Street investors, who were among the most eager adopters of pricing software.\nRealPage renamed its combined pricing software AI Revenue Management. By the end of 2020, the firm was reporting in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that its clients used its services and products to manage 19.7 million rental units of all types, including single-family homes. The private equity firm Thoma Bravo bought the public company a few months later for $10.2 billion.\nWinn, whose net worth Forbes estimates at $1.7 billion, stepped aside. He did not respond to requests for comment. \nA spokesperson for Thoma Bravo declined to comment.\n\n    Who Uses the Software and How It Works\n\nSomewhere around 2016, according to one trade group, the industry\u2019s use of the pricing software began to achieve \u201ccritical mass.\u201d\nThe more property managers who sign on to RealPage services, the more data flows into the company\u2019s repository. That in turn aids its pricing service, which the company says \u201cleverages multifamily\u2019s largest lease transaction database.\u201d\nRealPage\u2019s clients include some of the largest property managers in the country. Many favor cities where rent has been rising rapidly, according to a ProPublica analysis of five of the country\u2019s top 10 property managers as of 2020. All five use RealPage pricing software in at least some buildings, and together they control thousands of apartments in metro areas such as Denver, Nashville, Atlanta and Seattle, where rents for a typical two-bedroom apartment rose 30% or more between 2014 and 2019.\nGreystar and FPI Management each control hundreds of buildings in metro areas where rents have risen steeply in recent years. And Equity Residential, Lincoln Property Company and Mid-America Apartment Communities each manage dozens of buildings in high-growth markets.\nIn contrast, these same companies control fewer buildings in metro areas such as Philadelphia, Tampa and Chicago, where rents have increased more slowly, the analysis found.\nMany factors may cause RealPage clients to cluster in high rent-growth markets. The company\u2019s clients may gravitate toward such markets because those areas will bear more rent hikes and so offer an opportunity to make more money, for instance. But RealPage says its software steers pricing that beats the market in areas where it operates.\nRealPage\u2019s algorithm calculates how demand for apartments responds to changes in price \u2014 what\u2019s known as price elasticity.\nThe algorithm takes into account characteristics of apartments, like the number of bedrooms. It also considers factors such as how many more of a complex\u2019s apartments are likely to become available in the near future. Property managers can adjust settings according to their priorities \u2014 such as how full they want their buildings to be.\nThe software also analyzes rent prices in the broader market, the company said. That data can provide insight into how competitors\u2019 buildings located near the client \u2014 such as within, say, a half-mile or mile radius \u2014 are being priced, said Ryan Kimura, a former RealPage executive.\nOne advantage RealPage\u2019s data warehouse had was its access to actual lease transactions \u2014 giving it the true rents paid, instead of simply those a landlord advertised, RealPage said.\nProperty managers can\u2019t look at the unpublished data any one rival is sharing with YieldStar, Roper and other former RealPage employees said.\nNicole Lott said that when the building where she worked as a property manager near Dallas started using YieldStar, the software determined that similar buildings in the area were charging more. It pushed for steep increases.\n\u201cIt really jumped rates up,\u201d Lott said. \u201cLeasing slowed down to a crawl.\u201d \nShe and other staff challenged the software, asking the division of her company that oversaw YieldStar for a review, she said. The landlord ended up raising rates more gradually, she said. \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t think we could get those rates,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some cases we were right and in some cases we might have been wrong.\u201d\nKimura, a former RealPage executive who worked at the firm for three years before leaving in 2021, said the company would typically see pushback from property staff on about 10%-20% of the software\u2019s recommendations. It was part of the process. \u201cIf they are approving every rate and it\u2019s 100% acceptance,\u201d he said, \u201cthey basically have a blindfold on and are pushing a button.\u201d\nRealPage claims its software will increase revenue and decrease vacancies. But at times the company has appeared to urge apartment owners and managers to reduce supply while increasing price.\nDuring an earnings call in 2017, Winn said one large property company, which managed more than 40,000 units, learned it could make more profit by operating at a lower occupancy level that \u201cwould have made management uncomfortable before,\u201d he said.\nThe company had been seeking occupancy levels of 97% or 98% in markets where it was a leader, Winn said. But when it began using YieldStar, managers saw that raising rents and leaving some apartments vacant made more money.\n\u201cInitially, it was very hard for executives to accept that they could operate at 94% or 96% and achieve a higher NOI by increasing rents,\u201d Winn said on the call, referring to net operating income. The company \u201cbegan utilizing RealPage to operate at 95%, while seeing revenue increases of 3% to 4%.\u201d\nBut the software\u2019s supporters say it\u2019s not driving the nation\u2019s housing affordability problem.\nThough soaring rent is giving the industry a \u201cblack eye,\u201d Campo said, the culprit is a lot of demand and not enough supply \u2014 not revenue management software. The software just helps managers react to trends faster, he said.\n\u201cWould you rather do your work today on a typewriter or a computer?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat\u2019s what revenue management is.\u201d\nUsing software like YieldStar is \u201ctaking what we used to do manually on a yellow pad and calling people on the phone and putting it on a codified system where you take the errors out of the pricing,\u201d he said.\n\n    RealPage, Seattle and Rising Rents\n\nTo see how rent-setting software can make a difference, look no further than Seattle, where over the last few years rents have risen faster than almost anywhere in the country, some studies show.\nLarge apartment buildings in one ZIP code just north of downtown, sandwiched between the Space Needle and Pike Place Market, are overwhelmingly controlled by RealPage clients, ProPublica found.\nThe trendy Belltown neighborhood, with its live music venues and residential towers, had 9,066 market rate apartments in buildings with five or more units as of June, according to the data firm CoStar and Apartments.com. Property management was highly concentrated: The ZIP code\u2019s 10 biggest management firms ran 70% of units, data showed.\nAll 10 used RealPage\u2019s pricing software in at least some of their buildings, according to employees, press releases and articles in trade publications.\nExpensive markets with high rents, like Seattle, tend to have \u201cvery high\u201d rates of revenue management use by landlords, Roper said.\nTwo buildings in the ZIP code \u2014 one with revenue management software and the other without \u2014 reveal diverging approaches to pricing apartments.\nThe Fountain Court apartments, 320 units clustered around a courtyard with a fountain, are about a half-mile from Amazon\u2019s corporate headquarters. The building is owned and managed by Essex Property Trust, whose executives told investors in a 2008 earnings call that they were implementing YieldStar in the trust\u2019s apartment buildings.\nAt the Fountain Court, rent has risen 42% since 2012, CoStar data shows \u2014 steeper than the 33% average increase for similar downtown buildings.\nTenant Amanda Tolep and her husband were approaching the end of their lease for a one-bedroom at the six-story building near the end of 2021 when they learned rent would jump about $400, to $1,600. The increase amounted to 33% \u2014 in one year.\nTolep had been working as a barista and launching her own nutrition-related business. Her husband worked for a bank. They expected their rent to go up, knowing they had received a \u201cCOVID deal.\u201d But the size of the jump, along with other nuisances \u2014 like stolen packages and noise from a nearby fire station \u2014 led them to look elsewhere.\nAfter finding prices similar to their raised rent at several other neighborhood buildings, the couple decided to leave the city and move a half-hour\u2019s drive north.\nA spokesperson for Essex declined to comment. None of the other biggest property managers commented on the record about their use of revenue management.\nAbout six blocks away, rent has not gone up as dramatically at The Humphrey Apartments, a historic six-story brick building with 74 units.\n\n\n\nJohn Stepan\u2019s rent stayed relatively steady in a building that did not use RealPage\u2019s pricing software.\n\nCredit: \n        Jovelle Tamayo for ProPublica\n    \n\n\nJohn Stepan, a writer for a tech company, moved into a studio in the 1923 building a little more than a year ago. It was small, but he liked the high ceilings, hardwood floors and farmhouse-style kitchen. He had secured a COVID deal, too: one month free, with rent of $1,295 a month after that.\nA few months before his lease was up, the building notified him that rent would increase by $50, which amounted to about a 3.9% rise. \u201cIt was surprisingly low,\u201d said Stepan, who left only because he found a condo to buy nearby.\nTami Drougas, the asset manager who oversees The Humphrey and two other Seattle-area buildings for the local real estate developer who owns them, said she doesn\u2019t use a revenue management system. \n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in them,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s great and fine for larger corporations. But I think it takes the humanity out of what we do.\u201d\nAfter 24 years in the industry, she said, she sees good relationships with tenants and vendors as the key to running a building successfully. She said The Humphrey has low costs related to vacancies.\nThe building\u2019s rent has barely budged in recent years, she acknowledged. \u201cWe have a lot less turnover and I feel like that keeps expenses down,\u201d Drougas said.\nSeattle has been hit particularly hard by soaring rents. One report found the city had the steepest rent growth of any major city in the nation over the decade ending in 2019. Almost 46,000 Seattle households were spending more than half their incomes on housing, making them what federal standards call \u201cseverely cost-burdened,\u201d according to a 2021 study the city commissioned. Many families have trouble paying for necessities like food and medical care when their rent eats up 30% or more of their income.\n\u201cMany others have been priced out of Seattle altogether due to rapidly rising rents and housing prices,\u201d the study said.\nIt also found that people with higher incomes often \u201cdown rented,\u201d choosing cheaper apartments that would otherwise have been available to people making less. Seattle should have had a surplus of 9,000 apartments affordable to people making 80% or less of the median income, the study found. But tenants\u2019 down renting as prices rose turned that surplus into a deficit of 21,000.\n\n\nNewly Rent-Burdened Workers Range From Accountants to Groundskeepers\n\nIn metro Seattle, more people in a variety of jobs are spending over 30% of their income on rent. Below are the 10 occupations where the share of rent-burdened households jumped the most.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare of households that are rent-burdened in:\n\n\nGrounds maintenance workers\n\n\nPolice officers and detectives\n\n\nManufacturing supervisors\n\n\nComputer scientists, network \u200b\n\n\nanalysts & web developers\n\n\nElectrical and electronics \u200b\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare of households that are rent-burdened in:\n\n\nGrounds maintenance workers\n\n\nPolice officers and detectives\n\n\nManufacturing supervisors\n\n\nComputer scientists, network \u200b\n\n\nanalysts & web developers\n\n\nElectrical and electronics \u200b\n\n\n\n\nNote: A household\u2019s occupation was determined by the job held by the highest earner in each household; to determine if a household is cost-burdened, gross rent (including utilities) was divided by total household income. Homeowners were not included.

The startling concentration of property management in Belltown mirrors a national trend.\nThe number of apartments controlled by the country\u2019s 50 largest property managers has grown every year for 14 years, according to the National Multifamily Housing Council, which surveys buildings with five or more units.\nThose firms oversaw about 1 in 6 such apartments nationwide in 2019, amounting to 3.6 million units. By 2021, the number had risen to almost 4.2 million.\nJames Nelson, a former bank examiner and loan broker, noticed the concentration of landlords when he and his partner moved to Seattle in 2018. \nTroubled by astronomical home sale prices and high rents, Nelson began looking at what was happening in the broader market.\nAfter some digging, he found that many if not most of the bigger apartment managers in Seattle appeared to be using price-setting software. \u201cThe name RealPage kept popping up,\u201d said Nelson, who is retired and writing a book on his research. \u201cI went in and looked at the technologies that they were using.\u201d\nHe concluded the landlords were using tech to do exactly what RealPage advertised it could do \u2014 help them charge high rents and beat the market.\n\u201cThere is no competition,\u201d he said.\n\n    Concerns About Competition\n\nRealPage\u2019s software has gained traction at a time when the Biden administration, concerned about rising prices and corporate concentration, is looking to bolster enforcement of rules meant to ensure competition is flourishing.\nTo win cases, antitrust prosecutors have traditionally needed to show that competitors agreed among themselves to tamper with pricing. \u201cIf competitors agreed among themselves to use the same algorithm and to share information among themselves with the purpose of stabilizing pricing, that would be per se illegal,\u201d said Stucke, the former antitrust prosecutor.\nIf they simply shared information without agreeing to manipulate pricing, the question of whether antitrust law was violated would be more complex, he said. Stucke said he knew of no cases where companies had been prosecuted for what\u2019s known as tacit collusion while using the same algorithm to set prices.\nBut Maureen K. Ohlhausen, who was then the acting chair of the Federal Trade Commission, said in a 2017 talk that it could be problematic if a group of competitors all used the same outside firm\u2019s algorithm to maximize prices across a market.\nShe suggested substituting \u201ca guy named Bob\u201d everywhere the word algorithm appears.\n\u201cIs it OK for a guy named Bob to collect confidential price strategy information from all the participants in a market and then tell everybody how they should price?\u201d she said. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t OK for a guy named Bob to do it, then it probably isn\u2019t OK for an algorithm to do it either.\u201d\nThrough a representative, Ohlhausen declined to comment on RealPage. \nRealPage\u2019s software raises multiple concerns, experts said.\nCourts have frowned on sharing nonpublic data among competitors. Lease transaction data is not always public.\nAs far as RealPage\u2019s claim on its website that it uses \u201cdisciplined analytics that balance supply and demand to maximize revenue growth,\u201d Stucke said that businesses can\u2019t usually control supply and demand on their own. \u201cNormally that\u2019s left to market forces,\u201d he said.\nThe RealPage User Group \u2014 the forum for apartment managers who use the company\u2019s products \u2014 encourages rivals to work together, something that has been challenged as anti-competitive in antitrust prosecutions, too. The company\u2019s website says the group aims to \u201cpromote communications between users,\u201d among other things.\nStarting out with 10 members in 2003, the group has grown to more than 1,000 participants, according to the website. A dozen subcommittees, including two focused on revenue management, meet in invitation-only sessions at the company\u2019s annual conference, RealWorld, and participate in a conference call each quarter.\nThose sorts of collaborations, Stucke said, \u201ccould raise an antitrust red flag.\u201d\nIf clients are tampering with market forces, their assertions in RealPage marketing videos that its software keeps prices and occupancy \u201cmore stable\u201d could also become relevant in court, Stucke said. Similar comments have been used as evidence in previous antitrust cases.\nAnd the exhortations by RealPage and real estate executives for companies to use YieldStar and let some units sit vacant to raise prices are reminiscent of a legal case in the early 1900s, he said, where lumber companies shared information and a directive to reduce supply in order to push up prices.\nIn an email to ProPublica, RealPage dismissed the notion that the company was using market data improperly.\nThe company said that using actual rents helps the company \u201ccapture a truer picture of price elasticity and affordability,\u201d which reduces the odds a unit is overpriced. And the lease transaction data RealPage is using isn\u2019t always private; sometimes such data is disclosed, the company said, such as when publicly traded real estate firms make reports.\nThe FTC, which has broad authority to bring enforcement cases against businesses for anti-competitive practices, said in 2021 that it was seeking a more active role in such cases.\nA spokesperson for the FTC declined to comment on RealPage\u2019s pricing software.\nThe agency has tangled with RealPage before: In 2018, the company agreed to pay $3 million to settle an FTC complaint that the company had failed to do enough to make sure personal information used in its tenant screening product was accurate. RealPage did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement.\n\n    Higher Rents Are Burdening More Tenants\n\nDrama over rising rent costs \u2014 now a key driver of inflation \u2014 has been increasingly public. The year before the pandemic, roughly 46% of renters in the U.S. spent more than 30% of their income on rent and therefore met the definition of cost-burdened, Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies found.\nIn mid-September in Washington, D.C., angry protesters disrupted  the normally sedate yearly conference held by the National Multifamily Housing Council. Before security ejected them, they seized the stage and recounted how their families had been harmed by an inability to find safe, affordable housing.\nAt the center of the acrimonious debate has been RealPage\u2019s Jay Parsons.\nSince RealPage\u2019s own July conference, he\u2019s repeated a statistic, compiled from a company data set of new lease transactions, that market-rate apartment renters are only spending around 23% of their income on rent.\n\u201cThe reality is that rents can only rise as incomes rise,\u201d Parsons told The New York Times last month. \u201cIf people can\u2019t afford it, you can\u2019t lease it.\u201d\nBut his sunny view has drawn sharp rebukes.\n\u201cThis is demonstrably false,\u201d wrote Ben Teresa, co-director of the RVA Eviction Lab at Virginia Commonwealth University, on Twitter. \u201cOne of the defining characteristics of housing markets in the last 40 years has been rents increasing faster than wages.\n\u201cThe problem is quite precisely that people are paying rents they can\u2019t afford,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica?

Please consult an attorney for advice on how to interpret this information, its accuracy, and how the law applies to your individual circumstances.\u00a0California rent increase lawsAs a landlord or property manager, part of your job is to maximize revenue on your rental properties by aligning rental rates with current demand. However, this needs to be balanced with local and state requirements governing appropriate rent increase rates. Learn about how much can rent increase in California and how California rent increase laws determine how much you can charge for your rental property so that you can balance market forces with rules and regulations.Disclaimer: This article is strictly informational and is not legal advice. Please consult an attorney for advice on how to interpret this information, its accuracy, and how the law applies to your individual circumstances.With inflation on the rise and living expenses showing no signs of abating, landlords may be reevaluating the return on investment on their rental properties. In the face of mounting costs, it\u2019s only natural for you to be tempted to increase rent rates. However, if your rental properties are located in California, there are specific guidelines you\u2019re required to follow, including how often you\u2019re allowed to raise rent and by how much. Staying informed about the latest changes in law and regulation can help you navigate these challenges and ensure you remain in compliance. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the laws impacting rent increases in California for 2024. Please note that in addition to state-wide rent control laws individual cities may also have their own rent control laws.How much can you increase rent in California?California\u2019s Tenant Protection Act (AB 1482) restricts how much landlords can raise rent for their rental properties. The law imposes a statewide rent cap, limiting annual rent increases to 5% of the current rent plus the local rate of inflation, or 10% of the current rent, whichever is lower. To calculate the cost of living increase applicable to your market, use the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of inflation, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This method helps landlords adjust rent in alignment with economic changes while adhering to state regulations. The process involves taking the percentage change in the CPI and applying it to the current rent. Let's say you own a residential property with a current monthly rent of $2,000 and the applicable CPI for the relevant period has increased by 3%. To calculate the allowable rent increase, you would multiply the current rent by the CPI increase percentage:$2,000 * 3% = $60In this example, you could legally increase the rent by up to $60, bringing the new monthly rent to $2,060.Note: To calculate the allowable rent increase, the Tenant Protection Act requires all landlords to use the CPI from the previous April for their specific market area.Overview of percent increases nationwide Rent increase regulations can vary widely across different states, counties, cities and municipalities. But, how much can a landlord raise rent in California? While California has specific regulations governing rent increases and tenant protections, other states may have different laws or even lack statewide rent control measures.Some states, like Texas, grant more flexibility to landlords in determining rent changes, while others may have local ordinances that provide additional tenant protections. It's crucial for both landlords and tenants to be aware of the specific regulations in their respective states to ensure compliance with the law.Who is exempt from AB 1482?Certain types of residential properties and housing arrangements are exempt from AB 1482 including:New construction: Properties that have received a certificate of occupancy within the last 15 years are generally exempt from AB 1482's rent control provisions.Single-family homes and condos: Properties that are not owned by a real estate investment trust (REIT), corporation, or LLC, and are not a duplex where the owner occupies one of the units, are exempt.Certain affordable housing: Affordable housing units that are subject to specific affordability restrictions and regulations are exempt.Student housing: Housing provided by a public or private nonprofit university or college, or by a nonprofit organization affiliated with the university or college, for students is exempt.Short-term rentals: Properties that are offered for short-term rental through a platform like Airbnb or VRBO for 14 days or less in a calendar year are exempt.Government-subsidized housing: Properties with restrictions imposed by a government agency that limits rent increases are exempt.Employee housing: Housing provided by an employer to an employee as a condition of employment is exempt.Landlords whose properties are exempt from AB 1482 are required to provide their tenants a notice of exemption. If you suspect that your property falls under an exemption category, you can:Check with your real estate attorney to draft a notice of exemptionWhat to knowSecurity depositsRecently, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 12 into law, limiting security deposits for renters to one month's rent. The bill, introduced by Assemblymember Matt Haney, aims to address the practice of some landlords charging two or three times the monthly rent as a security deposit. Haney emphasized that excessive security deposits create barriers to housing affordability and accessibility. Effective July 1, 2024, the law makes California the twelfth state to cap security deposits at one month's rent. Small landlords with no more than two properties and four units are exempt from the legislation. For California residents, the move is a step toward improving housing affordability. Screening fee receiptsThanks to AB 1764, landlords and applicants can agree to receive tenant screening fee receipts by email. This makes the rental application process quicker and easier by cutting down on paperwork. While landlords can still provide receipts in person or by mail, the option for electronic delivery adds convenience and keeps things simple. Plus, the law ensures that screening fees stay fair and only cover the landlord's actual costs.Rent increase laws may also vary by cityAs noted, it\u2019s common for rent increase laws to vary from city to city. Here\u2019s a look at just three cities:July 1, 2024, through June 30, 2025, annual rent increases for rental units covered under the City of Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO) are set at 4%. If a landlord provides gas and electric services to the tenant, an additional 1% increase is allowed. Per state law, landlords must give tenants a written 30-day notice for rent increases of less than 10%.March 1, 2024, to February 28, 2025, the permitted rent increase percentage decreases to 1.7%. These percentages are determined by calculating 60% of the increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers in the Bay Area.Effective August 2024, the rent increase cap for the San Diego region was 8.6%, down from last year\u2019s limit of 10%. This adjustment reflects a slower cost-of-living increase, as determined by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 8.6% cap will stay in place until the next update in August 2025.Providing your tenants with a rent increase noticeNo renter ever wants to hear that you\u2019re raising their rent. But if you plan to do so, you\u2019re obligated to provide them with a rent increase notice. Why you need to provide noticeTransparency and legal compliance: Providing tenants with a rent increase notice ensures transparency and fulfills legal obligations in many jurisdictions.Respect for tenants' rights: Issuing a rent increase notice demonstrates that you respect tenants' rights and allows them to be informed participants in decisions affecting their housing costs.Budget planning: When you give tenants advance notice that you\u2019ll be raising the rent, it gives them the opportunity to plan for adjustments in their budget, making it easier for them to manage their financial commitments.Informed decision-making: Open communication through rent increase notices enables tenants to make informed decisions about their housing situation, leading to more positive landlord-tenant relationships.Trust building: Timely and clear communication about rent increases helps build trust between you and your tenants, reducing the likelihood of disputes and promoting a harmonious living environment.Minimizing conflicts through: Delivering the notice well in advance\u2014ideally adhering to or exceeding the legally required timeframe\u2014shows consideration for your tenants' circumstances. Proactive communication allows them to plan effectively and reduces frustration, which helps maintain a more positive landlord-tenant relationship.What to include in a rent increase noticeCheck with your attorney to see what specific information you should include based on your market and to determine the timelines for notification. When preparing a rent increase notice, be sure to include the following key components:Effective date: Clearly state the date when the rent increase will take effect. This allows tenants to plan for the adjustment in advance.Current and new rent amount: Provide the current rent amount and the new rent amount after the increase so tenants understand the specific change.Reason for increase (if required): Some jurisdictions may require landlords to provide a reason for the rent increase. If applicable, include a brief and clear explanation.Payment details: Specify how the tenant should make future rent payments, including any changes in payment methods or where payments should be sent.\u200d Contact information: Include updated contact information, ensuring tenants can reach out with any questions or concerns.Notice period: Indicate the notice period, which is the amount of time before the rent increase takes effect. This allows tenants sufficient time to adjust their budget or consider other options.Method of delivery: Clearly communicate how the notice is being delivered, whether in person, via mail, or electronically, and ensure it aligns with local regulations.Legal compliance: Ensure that the rent increase notice complies with local laws and regulations to avoid potential legal issues.H2: Practical Scenarios for LandlordsLandlords often face unique situations when it comes to raising rent, particularly in high-demand areas or with long-term tenants. Below are some practical scenarios that illustrate how state and local laws apply in real-world situations and how to balance compliance with profitability.Scenario 1: Calculating Rent for a 5% Increase Plus CPI in a High-Demand AreaBackground: You manage a rental property in a high-demand area where rent control laws apply. You\u2019re considering a rent increase for a tenant who has been with you for two years. The lease allows for an annual increase based on a percentage of the current rent plus the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This year, the maximum allowable increase is 5% of the current rent plus an additional 2% due to a rise in CPI.Calculate the Base Rent Increase: Let\u2019s say the tenant\u2019s current rent is $1,500/month. A 5% increase on this amount would be $75 ($1,500 * 5%).Calculate the CPI Increase: In this case, the CPI increase is 2%, or $30 ($1,500 * 2%).Total Rent Increase: The total rent increase would be $105 ($75 + $30), bringing the new rent to $1,605 per month.Legal Compliance: Make sure that the combined rent increase does not exceed the legal limit set by local rent control laws. In some cities, rent increases may be capped at a percentage of the current rent or tied to inflation, so it\u2019s essential to check the current legal guidelines before proceeding.Notice Requirements: As required by law, you must provide tenants with a 30-day written notice for a rent increase under 10%. Ensure the notice is delivered in writing and includes the effective date of the increase.Scenario 2: Managing Rent Increases for Long-Term TenantsBackground: You\u2019ve had a long-term tenant for over five years, and they\u2019ve been reliable in paying rent. Their current rent is below market value, and you are considering a rent increase to bring the rent closer to current market rates while remaining fair and compliant with local rent control laws. Determine the Legal Rent Increase Cap: Review the local rent control laws, which may limit annual rent increases to a specific percentage (e.g., 4%) or allow increases tied to the CPI. In this case, the allowable increase is 4%.Consider a Gradual Increase for Long-Term Tenants: If the market rent is significantly higher than the tenant\u2019s current rent, consider implementing a gradual increase over several years rather than a large hike all at once. For example, you could raise the rent by 4% per year over the next few years, staying within the legal limit, but still helping you close the gap with current market rent.Factor in Market Conditions: Evaluate the local rental market to determine whether your rent increase is in line with the area\u2019s average. If your long-term tenant\u2019s rent is far below market value, you may be able to justify a larger increase while still staying within the legal limits. However, balancing affordability with profitability is key to retaining tenants in high-demand areas.Provide Adequate Notice and Transparency: Given the long-term nature of the tenant\u2019s lease, it\u2019s important to provide ample notice\u2014preferably beyond the required 30 days\u2014to give them time to adjust their budget and seek alternative housing if needed. Also, consider providing a detailed explanation for the increase, including rising maintenance costs or changes in local laws, to show transparency and fairness.Offer Rent Stabilization Incentives: To soften the impact of the rent increase, consider offering incentives like minor repairs, upgrades, or even rent reductions for a limited time. These gestures can help maintain a positive relationship with your long-term tenant while balancing your own financial goals.Scenario 3: Rent Increase in a Rent-Stabilized AreaBackground: You own a rental property in a city with rent stabilization laws. The law caps rent increases to a specific percentage annually, typically linked to inflation or another index. The local government has issued an allowable rent increase of 2% for rent-stabilized units this year.Calculate the Rent Increase: If the current rent is $1,000, the 2% increase would be $20 ($1,000 * 2%). This would bring the new rent to $1,020.Understand Additional Allowances for Services: Some rent-stabilized areas allow additional increases if the landlord provides certain services like utilities. For example, if you also cover the cost of water or heating, you may be able to add a small surcharge to the rent.Legal Documentation and Notice Requirements: In addition to the rent increase notice, ensure you provide the appropriate documents. These may include a detailed breakdown of the new rent and the legal formula used to calculate the increase. The notice should be issued well in advance\u2014often 30 to 60 days, depending on local laws.Simplify your rent collection with RentSpree Rent PaymentEven after you raise rent prices, you still have to collect rent from your tenants.

    "title": "California Rent Control: What To Know About AB-1482 - Rocket Lawyer",
    "content": "\nWhat is AB-1482? What will the bill do?\u00a0\nAssembly Bill 1482 is a sweeping rent-increase cap bill signed into law by California Governor Gavin Newsom in September 2019. Beginning January 1, 2020, AB-1482 will limit rent increases across the state of California to 5 percent per year plus the local rate of inflation. The rules will impact cities differently depending on whether they already have rent-control laws. Unless otherwise voted, the measure is expected to expire in 2030.\u00a0\nWill my property be rent-controlled? Or am I exempt?\nThe cap on rent increases will most strongly impact landlords who own properties built more than fifteen years ago in cities that do not have existing rent-control laws. The state law will exempt buildings that were built within the last 15 years. This is a rolling date for compliance. In other words, buildings that were constructed in 2008 will be subject to the rent increase cap starting in 2023, buildings that were constructed in 2009 will need to comply by 2024, etc.\u00a0\nAB-1482 also exempts single-family owner-occupied homes, including residences in which the owner-occupant rents or leases no more than two units or bedrooms, that are not owned by corporations or real estate investment trusts. So, if you have formed an LLC to rent out your starter home, for example, you will be affected.\nThe bill also exempts duplexes where the owner occupies one of the units.\u00a0\nResidents who live in cities with existing rent-control laws will remain largely unaffected by this measure. They will, however, continue to be regulated by rent-control laws under the Costa-Hawkins Act, a California state law that allows an owner of residential real property to establish the initial and succeeding rental rates for housing that meets specified criteria, subject to certain limitations.\u00a0\nWhat else should I know?\nIn addition to the rent-control measure, AB-1482 will also require landlords to establish \"just cause\" before evicting tenants that have lived in a unit for more than a year. Landlords who want to evict tenants to build condos or make substantial renovations will be required to pay relocation fees equal to one month of rent.\u00a0\nUnder AB-1482, property owners will still be able to evict tenants for the following reasons:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNonpayment of rent\nA breach of a material term of the lease\nNuisance, waste, unlawful, or criminal activity\nRefusal to sign a written extension or renewal of the lease\nAssigning or subletting without the owner's consent\nRefusal to allow the owner to enter the unit\nThe owner moving themselves or family into a unit\nThe owner plans to substantially renovate\nThe owner is going out of business altogether\u00a0\n\nJust cause laws will essentially end the ability for a landlord to evict tenants without offering an explicit reason and will only apply to cities that do not currently have local just cause laws in place.\u00a0\nIf you have questions about AB-1482 and whether it applies to your property, ask a lawyer. For more information, check out our resources for landlords and tenants.\nThis article contains general legal information and does not contain legal advice.

    "title": "The California Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB 1482) | SF.gov",
    "content": "The California Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB 1482) is a statewide law that goes into effect on January 1, 2020 and expires on January 1, 2030. It is amended by SB 567.Requires a landlord to have a \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate a tenancy.Limits annual rent increases to no more than 5% + local CPI (CPI = inflation rate), or 10% whichever is lower.A tenant may not waive their rights to these protections and any agreement to do so by the tenant is void as contrary to public policy.An owner may be liable for penalties of up to three times the amountIf a unit is already covered by San\u00a0Francisco\u2019s local eviction and/or rent increase regulations, the unit remains subject to those local regulations and the statewide law does not remove or replace those tenant protections.\u00a0What the Rent Board can do\u00a0A tenant can file a\u00a0Report of Excessive Rent Increase Under the Tenant Protection Act\u00a0with the Rent Board if they:Live in San\u00a0Francisco andBelieve their\u00a0landlord has\u00a0increased the rent in violation of AB 1482The Rent Board will:Send a notice to the landlord acknowledging receipt of your reportTell the landlord of the applicable lawBut the Rent Board does not provide legal advice and cannot enforce state law or conduct hearings on disputes about AB 1482.\u00a0AB 1482 can only be enforced in state court. If you are a tenant, you may also want to consider contacting an attorney or a local tenant advocacy organization for help.Types of housing covered\u00a0All housing located in the state of California is covered by AB 1482 unless it falls into one of the following categories of exemptions:Units exempt from both the \u201cjust cause\u201d regulations and the\u00a0rent cap\u00a0limitationsUnits that were constructed within the last 15 years (this applies on a rolling basis - i.e.. a unit constructed on January 1, 2006 is not covered as of January\u00a01, 2020, but is covered on and after January 1, 2021).Units restricted by a deed, regulatory restrictions, or other recorded document limiting the affordability to low or moderate-income households.Certain dormitories.A two-unit property, provided the second unit was occupied by an owner of the property for the entire period of the tenancy.Single-family homes and condominiums are only exempt if both\u00a0(A)\u00a0and\u00a0(B)\u00a0apply:(A)\u00a0the property is\u00a0not\u00a0owned by one of the following:(i) a real estate trust, or(ii) a corporation, or(iii) an LLC with at least one corporate member.-----AND----(B)\u00a0The landlord notified the tenant\u00a0in writing\u00a0that the tenancy is not subject to the \u201cjust cause\u201d and rent increase limitations as specifically described in Civil Code Sections 1946.2(e)(8)(B)(i) and 1947.12(d)(5)(B)(i). See below for more information.The limited exemption for single-family homes\u00a0does not apply where there is more than one dwelling unit on the same lot, or any second residential unit in the building that cannot be sold separately from the subject unit (such as an in-law unit). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Units exempt from the\u00a0rent cap\u00a0limitationsUnits that are already subject to a local rent control ordinance that restricts annual rent increases\u00a0to an amount less than 5% + CPI.Units exempt from the \u201cjust cause\u201d regulationsUnits that are already subject to a local ordinance that requires \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate a tenancy and is more protective than state law (such as the eviction protections of the San\u00a0Francisco Rent Ordinance).Single-family, owner-occupied residences where the owner rents no more than two bedrooms or units, including accessory dwelling units and junior accessory dwelling units.Housing accommodations in which the tenant shares bathroom or kitchen facilities with the owner, if the owner lives at the property as their principal residence.Housing provided by a nonprofit hospital, church, extended care facility, licensed extended care facility for the elderly, or an adult residential facility.Transient and tourist hotel occupancy as defined by Civil Code Section 1940(b).Eviction Provisions under AB 1482The eviction provisions only apply after all tenants have lived in the unit for 12 months or more, or where at least one tenant has occupied the unit for 24 months.A tenancy may not be terminated unless the landlord has one of the allowable \u201cjust cause\u201d reasons, which must be stated in the notice terminating tenancy.\u201cJust cause\u201d reasons are categorized as either \u201cat-fault\u201d reasons or \u201cno-fault\u201d reasons. Relocation assistance is required for \u201cno-fault\u201d evictions.The mere expiration of a lease or rental agreement is not a \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate a tenancy.Rent increase limits under AB 1482For covered units, annual rent increases are limited to no more than 5% plus the percentage change in the cost of living for the region in which the property is located, or 10% whichever is lower. \"Percentage change in the cost of living\" means the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers for All Items for the metropolitan area in which the property is located,\u00a0as published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. If a regional index is not available, the CPI Index for All Urban Consumers for all items, as determined by the Department of Industrial Relations, shall apply (www.dir.ca.gov/OPRL/CAPriceIndex.htm).\u00a0\u00a0For rent increases that take effect before August 1 of any calendar year, the percentage change is calculated using the amount published for April (or March, if no amount is published for April) of the immediately preceding calendar year and April (or March) of the year before that.For rent increases that take effect on or after August 1 of any calendar year, the percentage change is calculated using the amount published for April (or March, if no amount is published for April) of that calendar year and April (or March) of the immediately preceding calendar year.The percentage change must be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of one percent.No more than two increases in a 12-month period, and the combined amount cannot exceed the 5% + CPI cap.The current applicable CPI increase\u00a0for San\u00a0Francisco\u00a0(that is, from August 1, 2025\u00a0to July 31, 2026), is 1.3%. Thus, the maximum annual increase for units subject to AB 1482 is currently 6.3% (5% + 1.3%). If the increase is effective on or after August 1, 2026, a different CPI increase will apply.\u00a0If the rent was increased by more than 5% + CPI between March 15, 2019 and January 1, 2020, then on January 1, 2020 the rent will revert to the rent on March 15, 2019, plus the allowable increase of 5% + CPI. Landlords do not have to return overpayments of rent made between March 15, 2019 and January 1, 2020.The total rent paid by subtenants to a master tenant cannot exceed the rent charged by the landlord.There is no limit on the initial rent charged for a vacant unit.Notices required under AB 1482All tenants in units covered by the state law must receive a notice explaining the \u201cjust cause\u201d and rent cap protections. For a tenancy existing prior to July 1, 2020, the notice must be provided in writing to the tenant no later than August 1, 2020, or as an addendum to the lease or rental agreement. For any tenancy commenced or renewed on or after July 1, 2020, the notice must be provided as an addendum to the lease or rental agreement, or as a written notice signed by the tenant with a copy provided to the tenant. The notice language must read: \u201cCalifornia law limits the amount your rent can be increased. See Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code for more information. California law also provides that after all of the tenants have continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 12 months or more or at least one of the tenants has continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 24 months or more, a landlord must provide a statement of cause in any notice to terminate a tenancy. See Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code for more information.\u201dIn addition, an owner claiming an exemption from the law because the property is a single-family home or condominium\u00a0must\u00a0provide a written notice to the tenant. For a tenancy existing before July 1, 2020, this notice may, but is not required to, be provided in the rental agreement. For any tenancy commenced or renewed on or after July 1, 2020, this notice must be provided in the rental agreement. If the owner does not provide the required notice, then a single-family home or condominium\u00a0is NOT exempt from the \u201cjust cause\u201d or rent cap regulations. The notice language must read: \u201cThis property is not subject to the rent limits imposed by Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code and is not subject to the just cause requirements of Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code. This property meets the requirements of Sections 1947.12 (d)(5) and 1946.2 (e)(8) of the Civil Code and the owner is not any of the following: (1) a real estate investment trust, as defined by Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code; (2) a corporation; or (3) a limited liability company in which at least one member is a corporation.\u201dDamagesAn owner who attempts to recover possession of a rental unit in material violation of this section shall be liable to the tenant in a civil action for all of the following: (A) Actual damages; (B) In the court\u2019s discretion, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs; (C) Upon a showing that the owner has acted willfully or with oppression, fraud, or malice, up to three times the actual damages. An award may also be entered for punitive damages for the benefit of the tenant against the owner.An owner who demands, accepts, receives, or retains any payment of rent in excess of the maximum rent allowed by this section shall be liable in a civil action to the tenant from whom those payments are demanded, accepted, received, or retained for all of the following: (A) Injunctive relief; (B) Damages in the amount by which any payment demanded, accepted, received, or retained exceeds the maximum allowable rent; (C) In the court\u2019s discretion, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs; (D) Upon a showing that the owner has acted willfully or with oppression, fraud, or malice, damages up to three times the amount by which any payment demanded, accepted, received, or retained exceeds the maximum allowable rent.",

    "content": "The California Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB 1482) is a statewide law that goes into effect on January 1, 2020 and expires on January 1, 2030. It is amended by SB 567.Requires a landlord to have a \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate a tenancy.Limits annual rent increases to no more than 5% + local CPI (CPI = inflation rate), or 10% whichever is lower.A tenant may not waive their rights to these protections and any agreement to do so by the tenant is void as contrary to public policy.An owner may be liable for penalties of up to three times the amountIf a unit is already covered by San\u00a0Francisco\u2019s local eviction and/or rent increase regulations, the unit remains subject to those local regulations and the statewide law does not remove or replace those tenant protections.\u00a0What the Rent Board can do\u00a0A tenant can file a\u00a0Report of Excessive Rent Increase Under the Tenant Protection Act\u00a0with the Rent Board if they:Live in San\u00a0Francisco andBelieve their\u00a0landlord has\u00a0increased the rent in violation of AB 1482The Rent Board will:Send a notice to the landlord acknowledging receipt of your reportTell the landlord of the applicable lawBut the Rent Board does not provide legal advice and cannot enforce state law or conduct hearings on disputes about AB 1482.\u00a0AB 1482 can only be enforced in state court. If you are a tenant, you may also want to consider contacting an attorney or a local tenant advocacy organization for help.Types of housing covered\u00a0All housing located in the state of California is covered by AB 1482 unless it falls into one of the following categories of exemptions:Units exempt from both the \u201cjust cause\u201d regulations and the\u00a0rent cap\u00a0limitationsUnits that were constructed within the last 15 years (this applies on a rolling basis - i.e.. a unit constructed on January 1, 2006 is not covered as of January\u00a01, 2020, but is covered on and after January 1, 2021).Units restricted by a deed, regulatory restrictions, or other recorded document limiting the affordability to low or moderate-income households.Certain dormitories.A two-unit property, provided the second unit was occupied by an owner of the property for the entire period of the tenancy.Single-family homes and condominiums are only exempt if both\u00a0(A)\u00a0and\u00a0(B)\u00a0apply:(A)\u00a0the property is\u00a0not\u00a0owned by one of the following:(i) a real estate trust, or(ii) a corporation, or(iii) an LLC with at least one corporate member.-----AND----(B)\u00a0The landlord notified the tenant\u00a0in writing\u00a0that the tenancy is not subject to the \u201cjust cause\u201d and rent increase limitations as specifically described in Civil Code Sections 1946.2(e)(8)(B)(i) and 1947.12(d)(5)(B)(i). See below for more information.The limited exemption for single-family homes\u00a0does not apply where there is more than one dwelling unit on the same lot, or any second residential unit in the building that cannot be sold separately from the subject unit (such as an in-law unit). \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Units exempt from the\u00a0rent cap\u00a0limitationsUnits that are already subject to a local rent control ordinance that restricts annual rent increases\u00a0to an amount less than 5% + CPI.Units exempt from the \u201cjust cause\u201d regulationsUnits that are already subject to a local ordinance that requires \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate a tenancy and is more protective than state law (such as the eviction protections of the San\u00a0Francisco Rent Ordinance).Single-family, owner-occupied residences where the owner rents no more than two bedrooms or units, including accessory dwelling units and junior accessory dwelling units.Housing accommodations in which the tenant shares bathroom or kitchen facilities with the owner, if the owner lives at the property as their principal residence.Housing provided by a nonprofit hospital, church, extended care facility, licensed extended care facility for the elderly, or an adult residential facility.Transient and tourist hotel occupancy as defined by Civil Code Section 1940(b).Eviction Provisions under AB 1482The eviction provisions only apply after all tenants have lived in the unit for 12 months or more, or where at least one tenant has occupied the unit for 24 months.A tenancy may not be terminated unless the landlord has one of the allowable \u201cjust cause\u201d reasons, which must be stated in the notice terminating tenancy.\u201cJust cause\u201d reasons are categorized as either \u201cat-fault\u201d reasons or \u201cno-fault\u201d reasons. Relocation assistance is required for \u201cno-fault\u201d evictions.The mere expiration of a lease or rental agreement is not a \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate a tenancy.Rent increase limits under AB 1482For covered units, annual rent increases are limited to no more than 5% plus the percentage change in the cost of living for the region in which the property is located, or 10% whichever is lower. \"Percentage change in the cost of living\" means the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers for All Items for the metropolitan area in which the property is located,\u00a0as published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. If a regional index is not available, the CPI Index for All Urban Consumers for all items, as determined by the Department of Industrial Relations, shall apply (www.dir.ca.gov/OPRL/CAPriceIndex.htm).\u00a0\u00a0For rent increases that take effect before August 1 of any calendar year, the percentage change is calculated using the amount published for April (or March, if no amount is published for April) of the immediately preceding calendar year and April (or March) of the year before that.For rent increases that take effect on or after August 1 of any calendar year, the percentage change is calculated using the amount published for April (or March, if no amount is published for April) of that calendar year and April (or March) of the immediately preceding calendar year.The percentage change must be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of one percent.No more than two increases in a 12-month period, and the combined amount cannot exceed the 5% + CPI cap.The current applicable CPI increase\u00a0for San\u00a0Francisco\u00a0(that is, from August 1, 2025\u00a0to July 31, 2026), is 1.3%. Thus, the maximum annual increase for units subject to AB 1482 is currently 6.3% (5% + 1.3%). If the increase is effective on or after August 1, 2026, a different CPI increase will apply.\u00a0If the rent was increased by more than 5% + CPI between March 15, 2019 and January 1, 2020, then on January 1, 2020 the rent will revert to the rent on March 15, 2019, plus the allowable increase of 5% + CPI. Landlords do not have to return overpayments of rent made between March 15, 2019 and January 1, 2020.The total rent paid by subtenants to a master tenant cannot exceed the rent charged by the landlord.There is no limit on the initial rent charged for a vacant unit.Notices required under AB 1482All tenants in units covered by the state law must receive a notice explaining the \u201cjust cause\u201d and rent cap protections. For a tenancy existing prior to July 1, 2020, the notice must be provided in writing to the tenant no later than August 1, 2020, or as an addendum to the lease or rental agreement. For any tenancy commenced or renewed on or after July 1, 2020, the notice must be provided as an addendum to the lease or rental agreement, or as a written notice signed by the tenant with a copy provided to the tenant. The notice language must read: \u201cCalifornia law limits the amount your rent can be increased. See Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code for more information. California law also provides that after all of the tenants have continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 12 months or more or at least one of the tenants has continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 24 months or more, a landlord must provide a statement of cause in any notice to terminate a tenancy. See Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code for more information.\u201dIn addition, an owner claiming an exemption from the law because the property is a single-family home or condominium\u00a0must\u00a0provide a written notice to the tenant. For a tenancy existing before July 1, 2020, this notice may, but is not required to, be provided in the rental agreement. For any tenancy commenced or renewed on or after July 1, 2020, this notice must be provided in the rental agreement. If the owner does not provide the required notice, then a single-family home or condominium\u00a0is NOT exempt from the \u201cjust cause\u201d or rent cap regulations. The notice language must read: \u201cThis property is not subject to the rent limits imposed by Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code and is not subject to the just cause requirements of Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code. This property meets the requirements of Sections 1947.12 (d)(5) and 1946.2 (e)(8) of the Civil Code and the owner is not any of the following: (1) a real estate investment trust, as defined by Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code; (2) a corporation; or (3) a limited liability company in which at least one member is a corporation.\u201dDamagesAn owner who attempts to recover possession of a rental unit in material violation of this section shall be liable to the tenant in a civil action for all of the following: (A) Actual damages; (B) In the court\u2019s discretion, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs; (C) Upon a showing that the owner has acted willfully or with oppression, fraud, or malice, up to three times the actual damages. An award may also be entered for punitive damages for the benefit of the tenant against the owner.An owner who demands, accepts, receives, or retains any payment of rent in excess of the maximum rent allowed by this section shall be liable in a civil action to the tenant from whom those payments are demanded, accepted, received, or retained for all of the following: (A) Injunctive relief; (B) Damages in the amount by which any payment demanded, accepted, received, or retained exceeds the maximum allowable rent; (C) In the court\u2019s discretion, reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs; (D) Upon a showing that the owner has acted willfully or with oppression, fraud, or malice, damages up to three times the amount by which any payment demanded, accepted, received, or retained exceeds the maximum allowable rent.",

    "title": "U.S. Supreme Court Reopens the Federal Courthouse Door to Property Owners' Takings Claims | Shipman & Goodwin LLP",
    "content": "\nIn a June 21 opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court finally reversed a 1985 ruling that has prevented property owners across the country from challenging land use regulations and permit conditions in federal court under federal constitutional standards. In Knick v. Township of Scott, the Court restored the right of property owners to bring claims that government has \u201ctaken\u201d their property without paying \u201cjust compensation\u201d directly in federal court. The new decision promises a substantial change in how and when property owners may challenge the impacts of land use regulation.\n\u00a0\nA Shift In Property Rights\n\u00a0\nThe Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits government from \u201ctaking\u201d real property except for public use, and only if it pays \u201cjust compensation\u201d \u2013 generally, the fair market value of the property, or property interest, that government appropriates to itself. When government uses eminent domain to take private property for a public use \u2013 a public school or highway, for example \u2013 the issue is whether the government has fairly compensated the property owner for the land taken.\nBut sometimes the government does not take property for its own use; instead it issues regulations that substantially reduce the value of property (called a \u201cregulatory taking\u201d), or imposes on a development permit a condition that a property owner convey part of its land, or pay money, or both, to the government, out of proportion to the development\u2019s impact (called an \u201cexaction\u201d). In such cases, the property owner has a claim that government has violated its Fifth Amendment Takings Clause rights.\nA property owner\u2019s ability to avail itself of the full measure of the Takings Clause\u2019s protections rests on three pillars: The first is that the federal Fifth Amendment, as part of the Bill of Rights, is the \u201cfloor\u201d of protection \u2013 state laws can be more protective of property rights than federal law or regulation, but not less. Second, generally speaking, the federal courts have been more protective of property rights \u2013 more willing to hold that a regulation or condition has gone too far \u2013 than the state courts. Third, federal constitutional claims are generally brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the principal federal statute used for federal civil rights claims, which allows a successful plaintiff to recover attorneys\u2019 fees. Thus, a property owner\u2019s ability to gain the full protection of rights promised by the federal Takings Clause depends on being able to sue in federal court, having the court apply federal constitutional standards, and to being able to seek attorneys\u2019 fees.\nIn its Knick opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court finally corrected a 1985 decision that has had the unintended consequence of preventing litigation of federal takings claims in federal court.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWilliamson County\n\u00a0\nIn 1985, in a case called Williamson County Regional Planning Commission, et al. v. Hamilton Bank, 473 U.S. 172 (1985), the Commission revoked permits that had been issued to a developer of a residential subdivision, after construction had started. The developer went bankrupt; the bank took over the development, and sued the Commission for a taking without just compensation. During this time (the mid-1980s), the federal courts were trying to reduce a stream of property rights cases stemming from the tension between developers trying to capitalize on the booming economy and governments imposing limits on land development, to control growth and protect environmental resources. (One judge famously pronounced that \u201cthe federal courts are not the Grand Mufti of local land use disputes,\u201d and another complained that \u201cthe disgruntled developer seeking relief under [42 U.S.C.] Section 1983 is fast becoming a familiar figure in this court\u201d).\nIn Williamson County, the Supreme Court established two procedural requirements for takings claims. The first was \u201cfinality\u201d \u2013 before a takings claim could be brought, the property owner had to present the government with enough development alternatives so that the court would know with some precision what the government was allowing and prohibiting; in other words, the developer couldn\u2019t simply present one pie-in-the-sky plan, have it denied, and then be off to court, claiming that the denial was a taking without compensation. Second, the Court said that before a property owner could litigate a federal takings claim in federal court under the standards of the federal Fifth Amendment, it must first go to state court, seeking remedies available under state law \u2013 and lose. Only then was the federal claim \u201cripe\u201d for adjudication. The Supreme Court\u2019s apparent expectation was that if the property owner lost in state court, it could then pursue its federal claim in federal court.\nBut over the next decade, it became clear that this so-called \u201cstate court first\u201d requirement was having two unintended consequences. First, property owners began to follow the new rule by bringing their takings claims in state court, and losing, but when they tried to proceed to federal court, the federal court dismissed the federal claim, under court rules that prohibit the same case or issue from being litigated twice, as well as under the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d provision of the federal Constitution, which requires federal courts to honor state court judgments. In addition, in many cases, it took several years to obtain a state court final ruling, and thus Williamson County was not only delaying but extinguishing federal claims, because it was a rare plaintiff who could afford to litigate through the state court first, with the only reward being to ripen its federal claim.\nThis procedural Never-Never-Land spawned other mischief. Local governments filed motions to transfer takings cases brought in state court to federal court \u2013 and then asked the federal court to dismiss the entire case. Federal courts sometimes refused to allow plaintiffs to use the practice of \u201creserving\u201d their federal claims for later litigation. Some federal courts began to apply the Williamson County rule, which was devised under the Takings Clause, to federal due process and equal protection claims, even though such claims arise under a different part of the Constitution. And local governments eventually began to argue that Williamson County should be considered as established precedent because the U.S. Supreme Court was repeatedly rejecting petitions to reconsider Williamson County. So, it became the rule in takings cases that when a state court denied a claim, the property owner became barred from ever litigating its federal claim. Commentators began to refer to this phenomenon as \u201cthe Williamson Trap.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA 20-Year Effort\n\u00a0\nOur firm, Shipman & Goodwin, has been working with the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and its legal team for more than 20 years to get a case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse the state-court-first rule of Williamson County. In the 1990s, we represented Connecticut builder Eric Santini when a state agency designated his under-construction subdivision in Ellington, Connecticut as a finalist for a nuclear waste depository, thereby halting the development and freezing Santini\u2019s investment for more than two years. It took six years before the Connecticut Supreme Court, applying state standards, held that Santini\u2019s property had not been \u201ctaken\u201d \u2013 the state agency had merely engaged in \u201cplanning\u201d necessary to deal with the important public issue of radioactive waste disposal.\nBelieving that a federal court would see his claim differently (and encouraged by NAHB), Santini then sued in federal court under the federal Fifth Amendment. In 2003, the federal Second Circuit court became the first federal appeals court to hold that Williamson County was wrong and Santini should be permitted to proceed in federal court. Santini, et al. v. Connecticut Hazardous Waste Management Service, 342 F.3d 118 (2003). This decision put the federal Second Circuit in conflict with other federal courts. But in 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court, in San Remo Hotel, L.P., et al. v. City and County of San Francisco, 545 U.S. 323 (2005), resolved the conflict by reaffirming the Williamson County state-court-first requirement \u2013 with Chief Justice Rehnquist and several other justices, in dissent, recognizing the unfairness, but not overruling it. Our firm also handled a case in the federal First Circuit called Torromeo, et al. v. Town of Fremont, New Hampshire, 438 F.3d 113 (2006), in which the court declined to overrule Williamson County.\n\u00a0\nThe Knick Case\n\u00a0\nEnter Rose Mary Knick. She owns a farm in Scott Township, Pennsylvania. Her farm contains a very old cemetery. The Township, by ordinance, declared her cemetery to be a public park, without any payment. The Pacific Legal Foundation, a property rights law firm in Sacramento that also has had Williamson County in its sights for these many years, took her case. She lost in state court, and in the federal Third Circuit, due to Williamson County. When it became clear in 2017 that President Trump would nominate a fifth conservative justice, four justices voted to grant review of Mrs. Knick\u2019s petition for review. Based on our long involvement with the issue, our firm was asked by the Chairs of two subcommittees of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee to file a friend-of-the-court brief in support of Mrs. Knick.\nThe case was scheduled for oral argument on the third day (October 3) of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2018-19 term. As readers will recall, Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to replace Justice Kennedy encountered a bit of a delay. As a result, the case was argued to eight justices. Those eight figured out that they were equally split, 4-4. So, after Justice Kavanaugh took his seat a week later, the case was scheduled for an almost-unheard-of second oral argument, which occurred on January 16, 2019.\nOn June 21, 2019, in a 5-4 decision, in which Justice Kavanaugh was the long-missing fifth vote, the Court overruled the Williamson County state-court-first requirement. Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, wrote the majority opinion. Justice Kagan wrote the dissent \u2013 and cited to our firm\u2019s friend-of-the-court brief, making the point that Congress should address the Williamson County ripeness issue, not the Court.\nThe decision itself is straightforward: It explains why Williamson County was wrong in forcing property owners to go to state court under state law first. The decision points out repeatedly that the Takings Clause of the federal Fifth Amendment is part of the Bill of Rights, and that takings claims should be allowed to be brought in federal court in the same manner as claims raising freedom of speech, protection against unreasonable search and seizure, and other cornerstone constitutional protections. The Court affirmed that the property owner\u2019s claim arises when the government takes action that impinges on development rights, not when (or because) it fails to pay compensation. The majority opinion states clearly that in overruling Williamson County, it is \u201crestoring takings claims to the full-fledged constitutional status the Framers envisioned when they included the [Takings] Clause among the other protections of the Bill of Rights.\u201d\nThe dissenting opinion focuses mainly on the fact that the majority had overruled a decision issued 34 years ago, citing the principle of stare decisis (\u201clet what is decided stand\u201d). In any event, the majority opinion explains how over 20-plus years after Williamson County, the unfairness and flawed reasoning of the state-court-first requirement had become apparent. The dissent also bemoans the federal courts being besieged with takings claims, with the majority responding that the Takings Clause is part of the Bill of Rights, and that Williamson County imposed a bar on such claims that has not been imposed on any other federal civil right.\n\u00a0\nThe Implications\n\u00a0\nTo understand how this new decision will affect property rights and land development, a brief review of takings law will help. Government \u201ctakes\u201d property either by eminent domain (a/k/a \u201cdirect condemnation\u201d) or by regulating its use so severely as to eliminate or at least substantially reduce its value, but claiming to do so for the public good, and not paying compensation (called \u201cinverse condemnation\u201d or a \u201cregulatory,\u201d as opposed to physical, taking). If the issue is an onerous regulation, to prove a taking and entitlement to just compensation, the property owner must demonstrate the adverse impact on value (which must be substantial, if not total); interference with \u201creasonable investment-backed expectations\u201d; and the \u201ccharacter\u201d of the government\u2019s action. A court then balances these factors (called the \u201cPenn Central\u201d test) to determine whether the government, by its regulation, is effectively imposing on the property owner a burden of lost value for which, in fairness, the government/public should pay. Exactions \u2013 permit conditions \u2013 must have a logical connection to the development\u2019s impact, and the condition must be \u201croughly proportional\u201d to that impact. The outcome of takings cases, of course, depends on the facts, but at this point the standards have been reasonably defined by federal courts.\nThe Knick decision, then, will make a big difference going forward in property rights cases in several ways. Overall, when state agencies and regulators regulate the use of land so severely as to substantially reduce or extinguish its value, or impose a condition that is not logical or proportional, asserting that the public interest allows them to do so without payment of just compensation, the standard for litigating such claims will now tilt decidedly back toward property owners, at least to where it was prior to Williamson County. State and local governments will now have to defend against these claims in federal court. The standards of the federal Constitution\u2019s Takings Clause, if more stringent than state law, are more likely to be applied. Property owners will bring more claims for takings, because it will be faster and less expensive to proceed directly in federal court. And the property owner will now have the ability to recover attorneys\u2019 fees if it prevails.\nAll of this said, perhaps the most substantial, yet at this point hard to predict, change will be the impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s now clearly established conservative majority, which at least in theory should be even more protective of private property and development rights than the Supreme Court has ever been before. The Knick decision reopens the federal courthouse door to property owners, but the five-member conservative majority promises to solidify protections of private property rights in ways we cannot at the moment predict. No doubt, federal and state wetlands regulation, floodplain regulation, mining rights, climate change, sea-level rise regulation, coastal regulation, and resiliency planning, among other programs, will all be tested, in the sense that government regulation in these areas, if it severely impacts private property use, will be challenged as an uncompensated taking. Governments will need to decide whether to defend, back down, revise, pay compensation, or reach some other accommodation between public and private interests.\nIt is hard to understand why it took 34 years for the U.S. Supreme Court to own up to an error, but at least the Court has now hit the Reset button so that more takings claims will be heard and decided on their merits, and in the appropriate court\n\u00a0\n\n",

    "content": "PLEASE NOTE: We are not attorneys, this is not legal advice, and these laws changes.\u00a0 I encourage everyone to contact an attorney in the event of specific questions related to their situation.Just Cause Eviction is a recent restriction passed into law by the California State Legislature that limits a landlord\u2019s ability to terminate a lease for a tenant once that tenant has occupied the property for longer than 12 months throughout California. This is separate from the California eviction moratorium extension for COVID; this is a permanent legal change.California can be a hard place to own property and it has gotten harder over the years, especially with everyone dealing with COVID.But just what is the new eviction law in California? How will AB 1482, the just cause eviction law, affect you and your property rental? Let\u2019s go over California\u2019s new eviction laws to explain what it does and what you should be doing to meet your obligations to your tenants under the law.Read below for a memo our attorney drafted for our clients at the onset of the new just cause eviction ordinance, that gives you a birds\u2019-eye view of the new rules, stipulations and caveats to be aware of. \u00a0Hopefully it helps you clarify what you need to do for your rental property.For Landlords:As you may be aware, California passed AB 1482, known as the Tenant Protection Act of 2019. This law established statewide rent control for applicable rental properties. If you own rental property in a city where there are more stringent rent control laws already in place (e.g., San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, East Palo Alto, Hayward, San Jose, Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Los Angeles, Palm Springs), then the local laws would control over the state laws.\u00a0 For any cities that did not previously have rent control laws, this new state law would apply to your city assuming your property is not exempted (see further discussion below).\u00a0\u00a0 We have asked our legal team to create this summary of the new law so you can understand your obligations as a landlord moving forward.The law caps the amount the landlord can charge for rent increases each year and requires \u201cjust cause\u201d for termination of the lease for tenants who occupy a property for more than 12 months.Rent Increase Cap:\u00a0 The rent increase for all leases is capped at 5% plus the change in cost of living, or 10%, whichever is lower.\u00a0 The CPI obviously differs by county, so you will need to consult the CPI for your area to determine the change in cost of living from April of the prior year to April of the current year.\u00a0 \u00a0For example, in San Diego County, the CPI increase from last year is 4.1%, so the most you could currently increase the rent in San Diego County would be 9.1%.You can find detailed information on rent increase in our article How to Raise Rent in California?Just Cause for Termination: The following are the only permitted \u201cjust cause\u201d reasons for termination of the lease where the tenant has resided in the unit for 12 months or more (*note this does not apply to exempt properties if notice has been provided to the tenant):At-fault Just Cause: A landlord must serve the tenant with a 3-day written notice to cure for any of the \u201cat fault\u201d reasons below that are curable breaches before evicting.\u00a0Default in payment of rentBreach of material term of the lease after notice to cure is servedMaintaining, committing or permitting a nuisanceCommitting wasteTenant\u2019s lease terminated on or after January 1, 2020 and, after written request from the landlord, the tenant fails to execute a written extension or renewal of the lease for an additional term of similar duration on similar provisionsCriminal activityAssigning or subletting in violation of the lease termsTenant\u2019s refusal to allow the landlord to enter the premises after being given notice to enter due to health/safety issuesUse of the premises for an unlawful purpose\u00a0Employee, agent, or licensee\u2019s failure to vacate after termination as an employee, agent or licensee\u00a0Tenant\u2019s failure to vacate and surrender possession after giving the landlord written notice of tenant\u2019s intention to terminate the tenancyNo-Fault Just Cause: Requires the owner to provide the tenant with a relocation assistance payment (equal to one month\u2019s rent) OR agree to waive the final month\u2019s rent.\u00a0 The landlord must give the tenant notice of the tenant\u2019s right to relocation assistance or rent waiver in writing. Failure to comply with this renders the termination notice void.Owner, spouse, domestic partner, children, parents, grandparents, grandchildren who intend to occupy the property as their primary residence provided the tenant agrees in writing, or the lease includes a provision allowing the owner to terminate to take back the property to reside in;Withdrawal of the property from the rental market;Owner has to comply with an order issued by a government agency or local ordinance requiring the tenant to vacate (*Note if the tenant caused the problem necessitating the termination, tenant shall not be entitled to relocation payments)Intent to demolish or substantially remodel the unit (i.e., structural, electrical, plumbing, mechanical modifications that require a permit, or abatement of hazardous materials, which require the tenant to vacate for at least 30 days. This does NOT include cosmetic repairs)Just Cause Exempted Properties: The following properties are exempted from the just cause requirements:Transient and tourist hotel occupancy (i.e., Short term rentals for less than 30 days)Dormitories (i.e., colleges, or grade 1-12)Housing subject to rent or price control through a public entity restrictionHousing where a tenant shares a bathroom or kitchen facilities with the owner who lives in the propertyHousing that has been issued a certificate of occupancy in the last 15 years (*Note this date is revolving)Single family owner-occupied residences where the owner rents no more than two bedrooms, including accessory dwelling unitsDuplex where the owner occupied one of the units during the beginning of the tenancy and remains in occupancySingle family homes, townhomes, and condominiums owned by individuals, family trusts, or limited liability companies so long as the LLC does not have any corporate members.\u00a0 (*Note single family homes and condos owned by a corporation, real estate investment trust, or corporate member LLC are subject to the rent control law)Rent Control Exempted Properties (Civil Code 1947.2): The following properties are exempt from the Rent Control law requirements:Low-income housingDormitoriesHousing subject to a local rent control ordinanceHousing that has been issued a certificate of occupancy within the previous 15 years.Single family homes, townhomes, and condominiums owned by individuals, family trusts, or limited liability companies so long as the LLC does not have any corporate members.\u00a0 (*Note: single family homes and condos owned by a corporation, real estate investment trust, or corporate member LLC are subject to the rent control law)If your property qualifies as an SFR, townhome or condo, for all new leases entered into after July 1, 2020, the exemption language MUST be included in the lease or addendum for the property to be qualified as exempt:\u201cThis property is not subject to the rent limits imposed by Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code and is not subject to the just cause requirements of Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code. This property meets the requirements of Sections 1947.12 (d)(5) and 1946.2 (e)(8) of the Civil Code and the owner is not any of the following: (1) a real estate investment trust, as defined by Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code; (2) a corporation; or (3) a limited liability company in which at least one member is a corporation.\u201dSo, to summarize the above briefly, make sure you look through this and consider it as you go forward.\u00a0 If you own a non-exempt property, even at the expiration of the lease, you may not be able to serve the tenant notice, or at minimum enforce them vacating the property.\u00a0If you would like to speak more deeply about this and other items related to property management, never hesitate to contact us.",

    "content": "Understanding AB 1482: Tenant Protections and Its Impact on Renters and LandlordsCalifornia Assembly Bill 1482, also known as the Tenant Protection Act of 2019, is a significant piece of legislation aimed at stabilizing the housing market by providing much-needed protections for tenants while balancing the rights of property owners. AB 1482 limits how much landlords can increase rents annually and sets out specific protections against unjust evictions. These measures are designed to prevent displacement, especially for low- and middle-income renters who are disproportionately affected by the state\u2019s housing crisis.Key Provisions of AB 1482AB 1482 primarily addresses two major concerns in the rental market: excessive rent increases and unjust evictions. Here are the core components of the bill:1. Rent Caps:\n\u2022 AB 1482 imposes a limit on annual rent increases. Specifically, it caps rent hikes at 5% plus the local rate of inflation, but in no case can rent be increased by more than 10% in a single year. This cap helps prevent sudden, steep rent increases that can drive renters out of their homes, providing tenants with more predictable housing costs.\n\u2022 Renters living in multi-unit buildings that are more than 15 years old are generally covered by this law, though some exceptions apply, including properties built within the last 15 years, certain single-family homes, and government-subsidized housing.\n\u200b\n2. Just Cause Eviction Protections:\n\u2022 Under AB 1482, landlords can only evict tenants for \u201cjust cause.\u201d The law distinguishes between two types of just cause: at-fault and no-fault evictions.\n\u2022 At-fault evictions occur when tenants violate the terms of their lease, fail to pay rent, engage in illegal activity, or cause damage to the property.\n\u2022 No-fault evictions, on the other hand, can only occur for specific reasons, such as the landlord or a family member moving into the property, the sale of the unit, or substantial renovations that require the tenant to vacate.\n\u2022 In cases of no-fault eviction, landlords are required to provide relocation assistance or waive the final month\u2019s rent to help tenants transition to new housing.\u200bAB 1482 is widely regarded as a critical safeguard for California renters, particularly in cities where rental markets have become increasingly unaffordable. Some of the key benefits include:\u2022 Rent Stability: By limiting annual rent increases, AB 1482 protects renters from being priced out of their homes due to sudden, significant rent hikes.\n\u2022 Protection from Arbitrary Evictions: The just cause eviction provisions ensure that renters cannot be forced out without legitimate reasons, providing tenants with greater housing security and stability.\n\u2022 Relocation Assistance: For renters displaced by no-fault evictions, AB 1482 mandates that landlords provide financial support, helping tenants cover the costs of moving and finding a new home.While AB 1482 introduces new regulations, it also ensures that property owners retain important rights:\u2022 Rent Adjustments: Landlords can still raise rents each year, but the law ensures these increases are fair and reasonable. The rent cap allows property owners to keep pace with rising maintenance costs and inflation, while also preventing exploitation of the rental market.\n\u2022 Eviction for Just Cause: Property owners maintain the right to evict tenants who violate the terms of their lease or engage in illegal activity. The just cause provision does not prevent landlords from managing their properties effectively, but it does require transparency and fairness in the eviction process.\n\u2022 Flexibility in No-Fault Evictions: Landlords are still able to reclaim their properties for personal or family use or undertake substantial renovations. However, they must follow the law\u2019s guidelines, which include providing appropriate relocation assistance to displaced tenants.Balancing Tenant Protections and Property RightsAB 1482 strikes a careful balance between protecting tenants and preserving property owners\u2019 rights. By preventing excessive rent hikes and arbitrary evictions, the law creates a more stable housing environment for renters while allowing landlords to maintain their investments.Challenges and ConsiderationsDespite its benefits, AB 1482 has faced criticism from some landlords who argue that it imposes unnecessary burdens on property owners, particularly those who own smaller properties. However, supporters of the bill argue that it is a necessary response to California\u2019s ongoing housing affordability crisis.\n\u00a0\nFor renters, while AB 1482 offers important protections, it does not address the broader issue of housing supply. California\u2019s housing shortage means that even with rent caps in place, many residents still struggle to find affordable housing.Conclusion: A Path Toward Housing StabilityAB 1482 represents a crucial step toward addressing the housing crisis in California by providing renters with greater security and predictability. By capping rent increases and limiting unjust evictions, the law helps to create a more equitable housing market while ensuring that property owners can still manage their investments effectively. As California continues to grapple with housing affordability, AB 1482 lays the groundwork for a more stable and fair rental market, benefiting both tenants and landlords alike.",

    "title": "These States Are Turning To Rent Control: How It Affects Affordable Housing | On Point",
    "content": "With\u00a0Meghna ChakrabartiWith about half of American renters spending more than 30% of their incomes on housing, advocates in cities and states across the country are building efforts to revive rent control policies.In February, Oregon became the first state to impose a statewide rent control policy. And lawmakers in New York, Washington and California have proposed bills they say will protect tenants and allow low-income individuals to find reliable housing.But why now? Is rent control is the best approach to lessen displacement and create affordable housing for all?GuestsShemia Fagan, Democratic state senator for East Portland, Oregon. Sponsor of Oregon's statewide rent control bill that Gov. Kate Brown signed into law in February. ()Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, professor of real estate and finance at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business. Co-author of the study \"Affordable Housing and City Welfare.\" ()Christopher Palmer, professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management (). Author of the study \"Housing Market Spillovers: Evidence from the End of Rent Control in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\"Interview HighlightsThe Cases For And Against Rent Control\"Economists are still united that rent control has a lot of side effects, and it clearly has benefits, as well, for the people that are protected by rent control laws,\u201d Palmer said. \"And I think that's why it keeps coming back. We have an affordability crisis and there is a deserving set of people that are renters and they're struggling.\"\"There are these benefits from having affordable housing units for low-income tenants. My research shows that you can think of rent control and affordable housing policies more broadly as providing insurance \u2026 if the loss of a job, for example, leads one to also lose one's house,\" Van Nieuwerburgh said. \"I think as long as needy households are the ones who are ultimately the beneficiaries of this insurance \u2026 there can be large benefits from provisions of this insurance [that are] large enough to outweigh these costs.\"Palmer: \"Rent control does a good job at helping current residents stay in their home, but it arguably backfires at making affordable housing more accessible. That is the pernicious effect of the fact that if you're going to cap rents, it's going to reduce incentives for people to supply housing. That might not be new housing \u2014 modern laws try to keep full incentives for supplying new housing \u2014 but people are more likely to convert to condos or to occupy their own unit. So we have a lot of leakage from the system. Rents end up rising for everybody else. It becomes harder to find a rent controlled apartment \u2014 everyone is staying there for a long time \u2014 and it makes the problem worse.\"Does Rent Control Benefit Those Who Need It Most? Not Always.Palmer: \"Often, the landlords we're talking to feel very squeezed. And I've talked to landlords that say, 'The tenants that I'm renting to make much more than I do and I'm subsidizing them while I'm being squeezed with costs rising for me.' \"Van Nieuwerburgh: \"[Rent control] creates, in my view, a lot of housing misallocation, where the wrong type of tenants ends up in a lot of these affordable housing units. Maybe they were low-income when they first qualified for these units, but then over time, because they're aging, their incomes go up and they make actually quite a lot of money, yet they're allowed to stay in these units. So I think this housing misallocation problem is also an important feature.\"How Do U.S. Cities And States Value Housing Stability, And What Are Its Benefits?Van Nieuwerburgh: \"This boils down to, as a society, where do we want to fit on that tradeoff between efficiency and redistribution equality? All of economics comes back to, where on the spectrum do you want your society to be? The fact that a lot of Democrats have returned to rent control, in a lot of different places, has kind of tilted that balance towards more redistribution, more equality, and I think this is a good thing.\"Palmer: \"People will look at the data and say, 'Where are the promised rent decreases now that we've had a little bit of an increase in supply?\u2019 \u2026 I don\u2019t think what we mean \u2014 and we need to do a better job communicating this \u2014 is that an increase in supply is going to lead to outright decreases in rent. The idea is that the problem will be even worse if we don't continue to build. And so I think that's one of the pressures that we see in areas where foreign money is coming in, or areas where there are other pressures on price, and homeownership becomes unattainable.\"Van Nieuwerburgh: \"There's something to be said for having socioeconomic diversity at the neighborhood level. I think part of what is driving this push for more affordable housing is this idea that cities like New York City are losing 50,000, 100,000 rent-stabilized housing units pretty much every year for four decades now, and it's affecting the ability of having economic diversity in every part of the city.\"What's Happened In Oregon?\"Here in Oregon, we saw tenants who had been longtime tenants suddenly displaced with just a 30-, or 60-, or a 90-day notice, even though they had been paying their rent on time for years, following the contract and being great neighbors,\" Fagan said of life before the state's new rent control laws. \"After a first year of tenancy here in Oregon, we\u2019ve now banned the practice of no-cause evictions. The landlord will actually have to have a legitimate cause in order to kick someone out of their home. And then, second, we have [added] a rent stability feature to our new law, which provides that during a tenancy, a landlord cannot raise the rent by more than 7% plus inflation. So roughly 10% per year.\"Unaffordable Rent As A Statewide Issue\"Oregon has the highest rate of homeless kids per capita of any state in the country. And Multnomah County, which is that big county that really encompasses Portland [the most populous city in Oregon], and the Portland metro area, is not even in the top 50% of Oregon counties facing homeless students,\" Fagan said. \"And we know that rent-driven homelessness is really the leading cause of homelessness here in Oregon. And so it really is a statewide problem, and it needed a statewide solution.\"Balancing Rent Control With An Increase In Affordable Housing Stock\"We want to make sure that we're not disincentivizing development, because we are about 150,000 units short, statewide, right now in Oregon. And so we need to be building units, and we're taking a 'yes, and' approach, not an 'either, or' approach,\" Fagan said. \"We have some other legislation that hopefully you'll be hearing about soon, where we are considering statewide banning of single family zoning in Oregon, and making sure that we can allow duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes on any property that otherwise meets city sighting and design requirements.\"From The Reading ListWashington Post: \"Opinion: The one issue every economist can agree is bad: Rent control\" \u2014 \"There aren\u2019t that many things you can get economists to agree on. Fiscal stimulus, minimum wages, monetary policy, health care, bank regulation \u2014 on almost all the major issues of the day, you can find a respected economist to argue for either side.\"But there are a few questions where there\u2019s near unanimity, and rent control is one of them. Pretty much every economist agrees that rent controls are bad. And in the last decades of the 20th century, economists had some success persuading state and local governments to curb these policies.\"Now the policy appears to be making a comeback. Two rent-control bills have cleared the housing committee in California\u2019s state legislature, and New York state looks like it\u2019s about to stiffen New York City\u2019s rent-stabilization regime and offer other cities the option to copy it. City governments may have to relearn why their predecessors pruned back rent-control policies.\"Rent control is supposed to protect poor, deserving tenants from the depredations of greedy landlords. And it does, up to a point. Research on rent control shows that many of the beneficiaries are low-income, and that controlling their rents makes it more likely that they\u2019ll stay in their apartments for a good long time.\"The problem is that rent control doesn\u2019t do anything about the reason that rents are rising, which is that there are more people who want to live in desirable areas than there are homes for them to live in. Housing follows the same basic laws of economics as other goods that consumers need: When the demand for a product consistently exceeds the supply, prices will rise until the quantity demanded is equal to the amount that suppliers have available.\"New York Times: \"Why Rent Control Is a Lightning Rod\" \u2014 \"A supply of housing sufficient to meet urban needs in California will not be built for decades, if ever, and right now building doesn\u2019t seem to be helping much. Many of the newer rental buildings carry high-end prices, while stock of affordable housing is actually falling.\"Given that, rent control is an easy and off-the-shelf policy tool that many people are familiar with \u2014 one that does help some renters and doesn\u2019t appear to cost taxpayers money. 'It is the best anti-displacement tool around,' said Stephen Barton, co-author of a recent report that called rent control a key measure toward stabilizing California\u2019s housing market.\"And yet economists from both the right and the left are in almost universal agreement that rent control makes housing problems worse in the long run. Here\u2019s what\u2019s behind their thinking and the nuances of the debate.\"Bloomberg: \"New York Adopts Sweeping Tenant Protections on Rents, Evictions\" \u2014 \"New Yorkers won historic rental protections from the Democrat-controlled state legislature over the objections of landlords who warned the changes would make it impossible to maintain their properties.\"The massive rewrite of rent rules \u2014 covering about 2.4 million residents of the city\u2019s 1 million regulated apartments \u2014 aims to preserve affordable housing by eliminating most of the tools that landlords used to remove units from regulation. The package also abolishes a 'vacancy bonus' that allowed property owners to raise rents 20% when a tenant departed.\"Senators passed the bill by a vote to 36 to 26, with the Assembly voting 95 to 41. The legislation is intended to be permanent.\"The vote came shortly before the current laws were set to expire. Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the legislation immediately after passage.\"'At the beginning of this legislative session, I called for the most sweeping, aggressive tenant protections in state history,' Cuomo said. 'I\u2019m confident the measure passed today is the strongest possible set of reforms that the Legislature was able to pass and are a major step forward for tenants across New York.' \"Sydney Wertheim and\u00a0Anna Bauman\u00a0produced this hour for broadcast.\u00a0Alex Schroeder\u00a0adapted it for the web.",

    "content": "\n\n\nCalifornia 2025 Rent Control Law for Landlords Explained\nThe California Rent Control Law (AB 1482), introduced in 2019, restricts rent increases and evictions to address the state\u2019s housing crisis. What is the rent control law in California 2025? The law will continue to protect tenants by capping annual rent increases at 5% plus local inflation, with a maximum limit of 10%, and requiring landlords to provide just cause for evictions to prevent unfair removals.\nSince AB 1482 links rent increases to inflation, new limits for 2025 will be announced in mid-to-late 2024 based on CPI adjustments. The maximum increase remains capped at 10%, typically ranging between 5%-8%, depending on inflation. These rules promote stability while holding landlords accountable.\nWhich Properties Are Exempt from Rent Control California?\nNot all properties fall under rent control California laws. Key exemptions include single-family homes and condos (if not owned by corporations or trusts), properties built within the last 15 years, and owner-occupied duplexes.\nWith SB 567 adding tighter eviction protections, landlords may face increased enforcement and legal disputes in 2025. Knowing your property\u2019s exemption status is crucial to avoid penalties. West Point Property Management, Inc. provides personalized guidance to help you stay compliant with California housing laws.\nLandlords Can Raise Rent by 5% Plus Inflation in 2024\nUnder AB 1482 rent cap rules, landlords in rent control California can raise rent by 5% plus local inflation, up to a 10% maximum. For instance, with a 4% inflation rate, a 9% rent increase is allowed. Exceeding this limit may lead to fines or tenant disputes.\nWith locations in Huntington Beach, Irvine, and Newport Beach, West Point Property Management, Inc. ensures rent adjustments comply with California rent control laws. Our accounts receivable services simplify rent collection, so landlords can focus on long-term success. \n\n\n\nThe extension of new rent control legislation reinforces California\u2019s commitment to balancing tenant rights and landlord responsibilities. However, this also means tighter enforcement of California rent control laws and increased monitoring of landlord practices.\nStronger tenant protections? Advocacy groups are pushing for tighter rent controls beyond AB 1482, potentially leading to local rent control expansions in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego.\nFor landlords, adopting tips for efficient tenant management is essential to navigating these changes smoothly. As a property owner, you\u2019ll need to ensure:\nLegal Rent Increases Based On The Ab 1482 Rent Cap\nEnsure that any rent adjustments remain within the legal limit of 5% plus local inflation, capped at 10%. Properly notify tenants of increases in advance to avoid disputes or potential penalties.\nJust Cause For Issuing Eviction Notices\nEvictions must be supported by legally valid reasons, such as non-payment of rent or lease violations. For no-fault evictions, landlords may need to provide relocation assistance.\nProper Documentation For Rent Adjustments And Legal Actions\nMaintain thorough records of rent increases, tenant communications, and eviction notices. Accurate documentation is critical for protecting yourself during legal disputes and audits.\nBy mastering these areas, landlords can stay compliant and foster positive tenant relationships while protecting their investments. \n\n",

    "content": "\nAssemblyman Ash Kalra (D-San Jose) has introduced AB 1157, which would tighten the provisions of California\u2019s statewide rent control regime, which was introduced in the Tenant Protection Act of 2019. It would reduce the size of the rent increases landlords could request from their tenants and make other changes.\nWhat\u2019s new\nThe 2019 rent control act imposed a statewide rent increase cap of the rate of inflation plus 5 percent with a 10 percent cap. The new measure would reduce allowable annual rent increases to 2 percent above the rate of inflation with a hard cap of 5 percent. Inflation would be measured by the consumer price index for urban consumers (CPI-U) for the metropolitan area in which the property is located.\nThe 2019 act was enacted with a sunset clause stating that the provisions of the act would expire on January 1, 2030. AB 1157 would remove this clause, making the provisions of the act permanent.\nThe 2019 act focused on multifamily rental properties and exempted single-family rentals from many of its provisions. AB 1157 would extend the provisions to single-family rentals.\nMeet the author\nAB 1157 was introduced by Assemblyman Ash Kalra, but it has attracted 8 co-authors in the 80-member State Assembly and one co-author in the 40-member State Senate.\nAssemblyman Kalra has made housing a focus of his attention with sponsorship of 3 housing bills in the last legislative session that became law. One bill extends the time tenants have to respond to a complaint for unlawful detainer from 5 days to 10 days. A second bill requires an owner of an affordable housing property whose rent restrictions are ending to sell the property to a new owner who agrees to continued rent restrictions, provided that the new owner makes a \u201cbona fide\u201d purchase offer. The original owner could retain his property by agreeing to re-restrict rents or by agreeing to not sell the property for 30 years. The third bill gives developers more flexibility to take advantage of changes in planning standards.\nThe California Apartment Association is rallying opposition to AB 1157. The rent control measure is still in committee and a hearing in the Assembly Housing and Community Development committee is scheduled for April 24,2025.\n\n",
