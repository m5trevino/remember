(1) Existing law declares that it is the policy of the state that no adoptable animal should be euthanized if it can be adopted into a suitable home. Existing law also declares that it is the policy of the state that no treatable animal should be euthanized.This bill, Bowie’s Law, would require an animal shelter, as defined, to provide in a conspicuous location on its internet website or a third-party internet website a list of all animals that are available for adoption or that are being held pursuant to specified laws, except as provided. The bill would also require the Department of Food and Agriculture to conduct a study on certain topics, including, among other topics, the overcrowding of California’s animal shelters, and, on or before January 1, 2028, to submit a report on that study to the Legislature, as
			 provided. The bill would repeal these study and reporting requirements on January 1, 2032.To the extent that this bill would impose a new program or higher level of service on local public animal control agencies or shelters, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.(2) The existing Polanco-Lockyer Pet Breeder Warranty Act requires every breeder of dogs to meet certain requirements relating to housing and maintaining dogs and to disclose specified information. The act defines “dog breeder” and “breeder” to mean a person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other association that has sold, transferred, or given away all or part of 3 or more litters or 20 or more dogs during the preceding 12 months that were bred and reared on the premises of the person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other association.This bill would change that definition to
			 a person, firm, partnership, corporation, or other association that has sold, transferred, or given away all or part of 2 or more litters or 10 or more dogs during the preceding 12 months, as specified. The bill would additionally require a breeder, before a dog reaches eight weeks of age, to have a microchip device implanted in the dog that identifies the breeder, except as provided. The bill would require the breeder, upon the sale or transfer of the dog, to register the identity of the new owner with the microchip registry company as the primary owner on the microchip device and would require the breeder to provide certain information to the new owner regarding the microchip. The bill would prohibit a dog from being sold or otherwise transferred by a breeder, whether for compensation or otherwise, until it has been immunized against common diseases
			 diseases, in accordance with veterinary recommendations for the age and breed of the dog, and has a documented health check from a licensed California-licensed veterinarian.(3) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to the statutory provisions noted above.
