The JCO does not regulate rent increases, however, state law AB 1482, the California Tenant Protection Act of 2019,  may regulate the rent amount in buildings that are older than 15 years old.Effective August 1, 2024 to July 31, 2025, the maximum allowable increase is 8.9%. Previously, from August 1, 2023 to July 31, 2024 the maximum annual increase for units subject to AB 1482 was 8.8%. (Annual rent increases are limited to no more than 5% plus the percentage change in the cost of living for the region in which the property is located, or 10% whichever is lower). Properties not covered under AB 1482:-Units that were constructed within the last 15 years (this applies on a rolling basis – i.e.. a unit constructed on January 1, 2006 is not covered as of January, 1 2020, but is covered on and after January 1, 2021).-Units restricted by a deed, regulatory restrictions, or other recorded document limiting the affordability to low or moderate-income households.-Certain dormitories.-A two-unit property, provided the second unit was occupied by an owner of the property for the entire period of the tenancy.-Single-family homes and condominiums are only exempt if both (A) and (B) apply:(A) the property is not owned by one of the following:(i) a real estate trust, or(ii) a corporation, or(iii) an LLC with at least one corporate member.                        —–AND—-(B) The landlord notified the tenant in writing that the tenancy is not subject to the “just cause” and rent increase limitations as specifically described in Civil Code Sections 1946.2(e)(8)(B)(i) and 1947.12(d)(5)(B)(i). -The limited exemption for single-family homes does not apply where there is more than one dwelling unit on the same lot, or any second residential unit in the building that cannot be sold separately from the subject unit (such as an in-law unit).     -Units that are already subject to the City’s RSO.
