The California Apartment Association today published the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rates for every county in the state. These figures are used to determine the maximum allowable rent increases that take effect on or after Aug. 1, 2025, for units subject to the Tenant Protection Act (AB 1482).
In mid-May, CAA released CPI figures for four metropolitan regions in California—Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego and San Francisco. With Thursday’s release of the California Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, which governs the allowable rent increases for units subject to AB 1482 in the rest of the state, members can now calculate the maximum 2025 rent caps for rental properties subject to AB 1482 across the state.
