California Assembly Bill 1482, enacted in 2019, is a significant effort to address housing affordability and tenant stability. This law aims to control rent increases and provide eviction protections across the state. With California’s housing crisis intensifying, understanding AB-1482 is crucial for tenants, landlords, and policymakers.

Rent Increase Limitations
AB-1482 limits annual rent increases to 5% plus the local rate of inflation, up to a maximum of 10%. This cap provides tenants with predictable rent changes, easing financial strain from sudden hikes. The law applies to most rental properties built before January 1, 2005.
Rent increases are linked to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), ensuring they align with economic conditions. Landlords must provide written notice of rent increases, adhering to statutory limits and timelines.

Just Cause Eviction Protections
AB-1482 introduces just cause eviction protections, enhancing tenant security by limiting eviction grounds. Landlords must provide a valid reason, either “at-fault” or “no-fault,” for evicting tenants who have resided in a property for 12 months or more. At-fault reasons include non-payment of rent, lease breaches, criminal activity, or causing a nuisance. These measures prevent arbitrary evictions and promote tenant stability.
No-fault evictions cover situations like the landlord or family occupying the unit, withdrawing the property from the market, or substantial renovations. In such cases, landlords typically provide relocation assistance, equivalent to one month’s rent, to ease the tenant’s transition.

Exemptions and Exceptions
AB-1482 includes exemptions and exceptions that limit its applicability. Single-family homes and condominiums are exempt from the rent cap and eviction protections if the owner is not a real estate trust, corporation, or LLC with a corporate member. Landlords must notify tenants in writing about the property’s exempt status.
Housing built within the last 15 years is exempt, encouraging new construction by allowing developers to set initial rents freely. Properties under local rent control ordinances offering equal or greater tenant protections than AB-1482 are also exempt.

Compliance and Enforcement
Compliance with AB-1482 requires landlords and tenants to understand their rights and responsibilities. Landlords must provide proper notice for rent increases and evictions, maintaining documentation to demonstrate compliance. Tenants should be aware of their protections to assert their rights effectively.
Enforcement of AB-1482 largely depends on tenants initiating action if they suspect violations. Tenants can seek remedies through local housing courts, often with assistance from legal aid organizations and tenant advocacy groups.
