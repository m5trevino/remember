Understanding the Tenant Protection Act/AB 1482 – Rent Caps & Just Cause

The Bureau of Labor Statistics has released reports for CPI-U changes from March 2024 to March 2025. 
CPI Percentages for Rent Increases Effective August 1, 2025, or Later:

IMPORTANT NOTE: Some declared emergencies trigger anti-price gouging rules which cap rent increases and newly set rents at no more than 10% over the last amount charged. The 10% limitation applies to properties exempt from statewide rent caps and to properties that are vacant and being advertised for rent. Members should consult the Governor's Office of Emergency Services website to see a list of County and Statewide emergencies: Click here. The specific portions of Penal Code 396 applicable to rental housing are subsections b, e and f. To learn more about Penal Code 396, click here.

Effective January 1, 2020, AB 1482 limits how much a property owner or manager can increase their rent in a 12-month period.   
Rent increases in any 12-month period are limited to 5% (percent) plus the change in inflation from April 1 of the prior year to April of the current year, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) for the area which the property is located. Some regions do not have a United States Bureau of Labor Statistics report, in which case the California CPI is used (i.e. Imperial County). 
For rent increases that take effect before August 1  of any calendar year, the following shall apply:  

The percentage change shall be the percentage change in the amount published for April of the immediately preceding calendar year and April of the year before that. If there is not an amount published in April for the applicable geographic area, the percentage change shall be the percentage change in the amount published for March of the immediately preceding calendar year and March of the year before that (Applies to San Diego & Riverside Counties).  

For rent increases that take effect on or after August 1  of any calendar year, the following shall apply:  

The percentage change shall be the percentage change in the amount published for April of that calendar year and April of the immediately preceding calendar year. If there is not an amount published in April for the applicable geographic area, the percentage change shall be the percentage change in the amount published for March of that calendar year and March of the immediately preceding calendar year (Applies to San Diego & Riverside Counties).  


REMINDER: Even properties exempt from AB 1482 may be subject to rent increase limitations as a result of Anti-Price Gouging rules that accompany emergency declarations for things such as fires. When these rules are in effect, rent increases are limited to no more than 10% of the previously charged or advertised price. This is particularly important to AB 1482-exempt properties and newly created tenancies. 

An owner/manager may increase rent up to two times in a 12-month period, but are still limited to the annual cap.
Vacancy Decontrol remains intact. You will be able to reset your rents to market rate upon all original tenants vacating.  
The bill is scheduled to sunset in 10 years.  
Just Cause termination will be implemented statewide and kick in at 12 months of tenancy if all tenants have occupied the unit for 12 months or more.  If there has been changes in occupancy, then Just Cause takes effect at 24 months.  
Just Cause applies to month-to-month tenancies and fixed-term lease renewals. 
At-Fault terminations include, but are not limited to, non-payment of rent, lease violations, criminal activity.  
No-Fault terminations are defined as owner move-in, withdrawal from rental market, a habitability order from a government agency, and intent to demolish or substantially remodel. 
Substantial Remodel

You must notify the owner within 30 days of receipt of the offer to re-rent of your acceptance or rejection of the offer, and, if accepted, you must reoccupy the unit within 30 days of notifying the owner of your acceptance of the offer;"
