Is your single-family home or condo exempt from California’s statewide rent cap and “just cause” for eviction provisions under the Tenant Protection Act (AB 1482)?
If so, make sure you have provided the required notice to your tenant.
A separately alienable unit (e.g., a single-family home or condo) is not exempt from AB 1482 unless it meets two criteria:
(1) It is not owned by a corporation, real estate investment trust or LLC of which a corporation is a member and
(2) Notice of the exemption is included in the rental agreement. 
CAA’s rental agreements dated November 2019 and later include the requisite statement. Alternatively, the exemption can be included in an addendum to the agreement using CAA’s Exemption from AB 1482 Addendum (Form CA-096).   
CAA has also created a new change-of-terms form to make it easy to add this provision to an existing month-to-month agreement:  Notice of Change of Terms of Tenancy (AB 1482 Separately Alienable Exemption).
Furthermore, CAA has created change-of-terms forms to easily add the other two required provisions from AB 1482 to the rental agreement, if needed. These two provisions are for properties that are subject to AB 1482. The first form adds an addendum stating that AB 1482 does apply to the property, and the second adds a provision stating that “owner move-in” is an allowed “just cause for termination.”
Notice of Change of Terms of Tenancy (Tenant Protection Act, AB 1482, Applicability)
Notice of Change of Terms of Tenancy (AB 1482 Owner Move-In Provision)
Both of these provisions are already in incorporated in CAA’s rental agreements.
To determine whether AB 1482 applies to your property, use the AB 1482 Provision calculator at AB 1482 — State Rent Caps.
