 The California Apartment Association today published the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rates for all counties in California. These figures are used for calculating the maximum allowable rent increases under AB 1482, the Tenant Protection Act, effective Aug. 1, 2024, through July 31, 2025.   CPI and Rent Increase Table    County of Property 2024 CPI Increase AB 1482 Allowable Increase (CPI + 5%)     Los Angeles 3.9% 8.9%   Orange 3.9% 8.9%   Riverside 4.3% 9.3%   San Bernardino 4.3% 9.3%   San Diego 3.6% 8.6%   Alameda 3.8% 8.8%   Contra Costa 3.8% 8.8%   Marin 3.8% 8.8%   San Francisco 3.8% 8.8%   San Mateo 3.8% 8.8%   All other counties 3.8% 8.8%    AB 1482 limits rent increases in any 12-month period to no more than 5% plus the percentage change in the cost of living (CPI), or 10%, whichever is lower. The CAA Regional CPI Calculator is currently being updated. The association will publish another article to inform members once the calculator is available. As a reminder, these figures should not be used to calculate increases under local rent control ordinances, which may use different CPI figures than those applicable to AB 1482 increases.
