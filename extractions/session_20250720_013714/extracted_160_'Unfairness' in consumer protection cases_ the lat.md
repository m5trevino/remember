In Capito v. San Jose Healthcare System, LP, the
California Supreme Court addressed a perennial problem - the definition of an "unfair"
business practice under Business and Professions Code section 17200 (section 17200).
Capito v. San Jose Healthcare System, LP (2024) 17 Cal.5th 273, 277-278
(Capito).
Section 17200 is California's analog to the Federal Trade
Commission Act (FTCA), 15 U.S.C. § 41 et seq., which declares "[u]nfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and
unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce" to be unlawful.
Id., § 45(a)(1). Many states adopted such "Little FTC Acts" in the wake
of the FTCA, and, like section 17200, authorized private individuals to bring
enforcement actions. See Milner, From Rancid to Reasonable: Unfair
Methods of Competition Under State Little FTC Acts (2024) 73 Am. U. L.Rev. 857, 879, 882 (hereafter Little FTC Acts). Ironically,
Congress was so concerned about the unbridled enforcement of a potentially
limitless "unfairness" standard that it refused to permit a private right of
action under the FTCA and limited the right of enforcement to the Federal Trade
Commission. See Holloway v. Bristol-Myers Corp. (D.C. Cir. 1973)
485 F.2d 986, 990 (Holloway) ["[T]his breadth of prohibition
carried with it a danger that the statute might become a source of vexatious
litigation. Expertise was called for, both to identify trade practices that
posed the threat of monopoly and to avoid using the statute as a vehicle for
trivial or frivolous claims. There was, furthermore, a need to develop a
central and coherent body of precedent, construing and applying the statute in
a wide range of factual contexts, so as to define its
operative reach."]; see also Little FTC Acts, supra, 73
Am. U. L.Rev. at p. 867.
Like the FTCA, section 17200 defines "unfair competition" to
mean "any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,
deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising." For many years, there was
virtually no limit to this wide-ranging statute, and plaintiffs could seek
relief for virtually any business practice regardless of normal rules governing
equitable remedies. See Barquis v. Merchants Collection Assn.
(1972) 7 Cal.3d 94, 112 [interpreting Civil Code section 3369, the predecessor
to Business and Professions Code section 17200: "[T]he section was
intentionally framed in its broad, sweeping language, precisely to enable
judicial tribunals to deal with the innumerable 'new schemes which the
fertility of man's invention would contrive' "]. Individual
citizens could bring representative actions on behalf of the general
public based on a single transaction without regard to the requirements
for a class action and without showing that they themselves had been harmed by
the allegedly unfair practice. See, e.g., Kasky v. Nike, Inc.
(2002) 27 Cal.4th 939, 949-951; Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores,
Inc. (1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 570; Committee On Children's Television,
Inc. v. General Foods Corp. (1983) 35 Cal.3d 197, 209-211; State Farm
Fire & Casualty Co. v. Superior Court (1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1093,
1102-1103; Hernandez v. Atlantic Finance Co. (1980) 105 Cal.App.3d 65,
71-73.
In response to concerns over the breadth of section 17200, the
voters and the courts tightened the requirements for a section 17200 action. 
Through a ballot initiative, the voters placed restrictions on section
17200 actions. Proposition 64 required individuals (other than public
prosecutors) to (a) satisfy the requirements for a class action in order to bring a representative action on behalf of the general
public, Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17203, and (b) demonstrate that they have
"suffered injury in fact and ha[ve] lost money or
property as a result of the unfair competition." Bus. & Prof. Code, §
17204. See Kwikset Corp. v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 310,
320-322.
In Kraus v. Trinity Management Services, Inc., Kraus
v. Trinity Management Services, Inc. (2000) 23 Cal.4th 116, 126-127. the
California Supreme Court restricted the remedy of restitution in private
section 17200 enforcement actions to the "return [of] money obtained through an
unfair business practice to those persons ... from whom the property was taken,
that is, to persons who had an ownership interest in the property." Ibid. Kraus
rejected the application in section 17200 actions of a "fluid [fund]
recovery" whereby a defendant disgorges into a fund money that is not to be
returned to the persons from whom it was obtained, untethered to the ownership
of the property to be restored. Id. at p. 127.
Most significantly for purposes of this article, the California
Supreme Court, in Cel-Tech Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone
Co., restricted the definition of unfairness to competitors by adopting a
safe harbor rule: "When a plaintiff who claims to have suffered injury from a
direct competitor's 'unfair' act or practice invokes section 17200, the word
'unfair' in that section means conduct that threatens an incipient violation of
an antitrust law, or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because
its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law, or
otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition." Cel-Tech
Communications, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Telephone Co. (1999) 20
Cal.4th 163, 187 (Cel-Tech). Where the Cel-Tech safe harbor
applies, the legislative authorization of or public policy favoring a business
practice "insulates" that business practice from section 17200 liability. E.g.,
McCann v. Lucky Money, Inc. (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1382, 1387; Bernardo
v. Planned Parenthood Federation of America (2004) 115 Cal.App.4th 322,
354; Schnall v. Hertz Corp. (2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1144, 1154, 1160-1161,
1166 (Schnall).
The enduring issue after Cel-Tech is whether the safe
harbor rule also applies in consumer unfairness cases. Cel-Tech,
supra, 20 Cal.4th at p. 187, fn. 12 ["This case involves an action by a
competitor alleging anticompetitive practices. Our discussion and this [safe
harbor] test are limited to that context. Nothing we say relates to actions by
consumers or by competitors alleging other kinds of violations of the unfair
competition law such as 'fraudulent' or 'unlawful' business practices or
'unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising.' "]; see Capito,
supra, 17 Cal.5th at p. 284 ["The UCL does not define 'unfair,' and the
'standard for determining what business acts or practices are "unfair" in
consumer actions under the UCL is currently unsettled' "]; accord, Nationwide
Biweekly Administrators, Inc. v. Superior Court of Alameda County (2020) 9
Cal.5th 279, 303; Zhang v. Superior Court (2013) 57 Cal.4th 364, 380,
fn. 9.
The courts have divided on this issue. A
number of consumer cases apply the pre-Cel-Tech definition of
unfairness that looks to whether the defendant's business practice "is immoral,
unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers,
and requires the court to weigh the utility of the defendant's conduct against
the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim." Drum v. San Fernando Valley
Bar Assn. (2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 247, 257 (Drum); see Ticconi
v. Blue Shield of California Life & Health Ins. Co. (2008) 160
Cal.App.4th 528, 539. 82; Bardin v. DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2006) 136
Cal.App.4th 1255, 1268-1270; Progressive West Ins. Co. v. Superior Court
(2005) 135 Cal.App.4th 263, 286; Walker v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc.
(2002) 98 Cal.App.4th 1158, 1170; Smith v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins.
Co. (2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 700, 718-719; Community Assisting Recovery,
Inc. v. Aegis Security Ins. Co. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 886, 894. But other
consumer cases apply the Cel-Tech "safe harbor" rule. See Graham
v. Bank of America, N.A. (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 594, 613; Aleksick v. 7-Eleven, Inc. (2012) 205
Cal.App.4th 1176, 1192; Lopez v. Nissan North America, Inc. (2011) 201
Cal.App.4th 572, 591-594; Durell v. Sharp Healthcare (2010) 183
Cal.App.4th 1350, 1364-1366; In re Firearm Cases (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th
959, 979-983; Schnall, supra, 78 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1157-1170. And
yet a third group of cases have adopted a definition of unfairness taken from
FTC jurisprudence that looks to whether: "(1) the consumer injury [is]
substantial; (2) the injury [is] not ... outweighed by any countervailing
benefits to consumers or competition; and (3) it [is] an injury that consumers
themselves could not reasonably have avoided." Davis v. Ford Motor Credit
Co. LLC (2009) 179 Cal.App.4th 581, 597-598, citing Camacho v.
Automobile Club of Southern California (2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1394, 1403.
Against this backdrop, the California Supreme Court in Capito
took up the "question ... whether hospitals have a duty, beyond what is required
by the relevant statutory and regulatory scheme, to notify emergency room
patients that they will be charged [evaluation and management services (EMS)]
fees." Capito, supra, 17 Cal.5th at p. 277.
The plaintiff filed a class action suit against a hospital challenging EMS fees for two emergency room visits.
She did not claim that the defendant had violated its existing disclosure
obligations or that the EMS fees were excessive or improper. She claimed only
that the defendant had a duty to provide additional disclosures of the fees
before the emergency room services were provided, and that the defendant's
failure to do so was an unfair business practice in violation of section 17200.
Id. at p. 277. 
The court rejected plaintiff's claim, finding that "[h]ospitals do not have a duty under [section 17200 or the
state's Consumer Legal Remedies Act], beyond their obligations under the
relevant statutory and regulatory scheme, to disclose EMS fees prior to
treating emergency room patients. Requiring such disclosure would alter the
careful balance of competing interests, including price transparency and provision
of emergency care without regard to cost, reflected in the multifaceted scheme
developed by state and federal authorities." Id. at p. 278.
To reach this conclusion, the court had to navigate the still
unsettled waters of "unfairness" in consumer cases. Id. pp. 284-288. But
the court decided it had "no need to decide either the Unfair Competition Law
(UCL) standard for 'unfair' business conduct" or "whether the statutes
governing hospital price disclosure create a safe harbor within the meaning of Cel-Tech"
because the plaintiff alleged only that defendant's " 'practices
offend established public policies, and are immoral, unethical, oppressive, and
unscrupulous.' " Id. at pp. 284, 288. The court then went on to hold
that because plaintiff did not satisfy any of these stated criteria within the
context of the regulatory scheme at issue, she "has not demonstrated unfairness
under the UCL." Id. at p. 288.
As noted, the court in Capito purported not to define
section 17200 "unfairness" in the consumer context. Id. at p. 284. However,
Capito's alleged unfairness standard - whether the defendant's " 'practices offend established public policies, and are
immoral, unethical, oppressive, and unscrupulous,' " Ibid, - is
much like the broadest pre-Cel-Tech definition of unfairness. See, e.g., Drum, supra, 182 Cal.App.4th at 257. Since the ultimate definition of unfairness in consumer cases is
unlikely to be more expansive than the pre-Cel-Tech formula, it is
reasonable to conclude that under Capito, an applicable statutory or
regulatory scheme will be relevant in consumer cases to determine whether a
particular business practice is unfair. Capito, supra, 17 Cal.5th
at p. 284 ["whether or not the statutory scheme here creates a safe
harbor [under Cel-Tech], we find the scheme relevant to discerning
whether [defendant's] conduct 'offends an established public policy' or is
'immoral, unethical, oppressive, unscrupulous, or substantially injurious to
consumers' . . . that is, whether Regional's conduct is 'unfair' under the UCL,
applying the standard stated by Capito"].
In short, Capito can be seen as a step by the California
Supreme Court toward reining in the definition of unfairness in consumer cases
by establishing the relevance of applicable statutes and regulations to the
unfairness analysis.
