California – Placer County

I have rented a condo for 16 years. My last fixed-term lease expired in March 2023 and explicitly included an AB 1482 exemption notice. Since then, my tenancy has automatically converted to month-to-month, and my landlord has not reissued the AB 1482 exemption notice.

I was previously informed that, under California's Tenant Protection Act (AB 1482), a landlord must provide tenants with a written exemption notice at the time the lease transitions to month-to-month tenancy, and I was told this notice needs to be provided annually to remain exempt for month-to-month.

Does the landlord’s failure to reissue the AB 1482 exemption notice upon the transition to month-to-month tenancy mean that my rental now falls under AB 1482’s tenant protections (rent caps and just-cause eviction requirements)?

Can anyone clarify if this exemption notice is legally required to be reissued in my scenario, and if so, does this lapse result in the loss of exemption status? Thanks.
