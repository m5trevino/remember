Our Mission
The California Building Industry Association (CBIA) is dedicated to advocating for policies that enhance housing production of all types, ensuring “Housing for All” while driving economic growth in the construction sector. We recognize the vital role our industry plays in California’s economic strength, contributing over $65 billion in activity and supporting more than 900,000 jobs. Committed to overcoming challenges such as barriers to home construction, limited insurance access, and the transition to sustainable energy, we strive to create a balanced environment that meets housing demand and climate goals. In response to the ongoing housing policy crisis, we are focused on facilitating the development of over 2.5 million homes by 2030 to alleviate the current housing shortage and improve living conditions for all Californians.

Our Future
To tackle California’s housing crisis and address inequities in homeownership amid the challenges of climate change, CBIA believes California needs common sense approaches that:

Increases Home Production: Support the construction of more homes at all levels of affordability.
Promotes Resilience and Efficiency: Ensure that new homes are fire-resilient, energy-efficient, and carbon-neutral.
Advocates Fair Policies: Enact policies that do not penalize middle- and low-income families for choosing affordable living options.
