The California Building Industry Association (CBIA) is dedicated to providing strong leadership through advocacy, education, and information.
As the premier advocate for California’s homebuilding industry, we remain focused on our number one priority: successfully promoting the homebuilding industry’s interests in the State Capitol and in the Governor’s Office, as well as before numerous regulatory agencies.
The CBIA team has decades of experience at some of the highest levels of government and we look forward to what we will achieve together.
