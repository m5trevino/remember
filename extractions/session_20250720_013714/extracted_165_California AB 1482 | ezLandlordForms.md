The California Tenant Protection Act requires this document, a written disclosure concerning two requirements: 1. Limits on rent increases and 2. a statement of cause in notices to terminate a tenancy. 


California law limits the amount your rent can be increased. See Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code for more information. California law also provides that after all of the tenants have continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 12 months or more or at least one of the tenants has continuously and lawfully occupied the property for 24 months or more, a landlord must provide a statement of cause in any notice to terminate a tenancy. See Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code for more information.


Exempt properties include: 	

Units that were constructed within the last 15 years.

Units restricted by a deed, regulatory restrictions, or other recorded document limiting the affordability to low or moderate-income households.

A two-unit property, provided the second unit was occupied by an owner of the property for the entire period of the tenancy.

Single-family homes and condominiums are only exempt if both (A) and (B) apply:    

(A) the property is not owned by one of the following:

	(i) a real estate trust, or

	(ii) a corporation, or

	(iii) an LLC with at least one corporate member.

                        -----AND----


(B) The landlord notified the tenant in writing that the tenancy is not subject to the “just cause” and rent increase limitations as specifically described in Civil Code Sections 1946.2(e)(8)(B)(i) and 1947.12(d)(5)(B)(i).



If exempt, place an x next to the following paragraph:


____ This property is not subject to the rent limits imposed by Section 1947.12 of the Civil Code and is not subject to the just cause requirements of Section 1946.2 of the Civil Code. This property meets the requirements of Sections 1947.12 (d)(5) and 1946.2 (e)(7) of the Civil Code and the owner is not any of the following: (1) a real estate investment trust, as defined by Section 856 of the Internal Revenue Code; (2) a corporation; or (3) a limited liability company in which at least one member is a corporation.
