California 2025 Rent Control Law for Landlords Explained
The California Rent Control Law (AB 1482), introduced in 2019, restricts rent increases and evictions to address the state’s housing crisis. What is the rent control law in California 2025? The law will continue to protect tenants by capping annual rent increases at 5% plus local inflation, with a maximum limit of 10%, and requiring landlords to provide just cause for evictions to prevent unfair removals.
Since AB 1482 links rent increases to inflation, new limits for 2025 will be announced in mid-to-late 2024 based on CPI adjustments. The maximum increase remains capped at 10%, typically ranging between 5%-8%, depending on inflation. These rules promote stability while holding landlords accountable.
Which Properties Are Exempt from Rent Control California?
Not all properties fall under rent control California laws. Key exemptions include single-family homes and condos (if not owned by corporations or trusts), properties built within the last 15 years, and owner-occupied duplexes.
With SB 567 adding tighter eviction protections, landlords may face increased enforcement and legal disputes in 2025. Knowing your property’s exemption status is crucial to avoid penalties. West Point Property Management, Inc. provides personalized guidance to help you stay compliant with California housing laws.
Landlords Can Raise Rent by 5% Plus Inflation in 2024
Under AB 1482 rent cap rules, landlords in rent control California can raise rent by 5% plus local inflation, up to a 10% maximum. For instance, with a 4% inflation rate, a 9% rent increase is allowed. Exceeding this limit may lead to fines or tenant disputes.
With locations in Huntington Beach, Irvine, and Newport Beach, West Point Property Management, Inc. ensures rent adjustments comply with California rent control laws. Our accounts receivable services simplify rent collection, so landlords can focus on long-term success. 



The extension of new rent control legislation reinforces California’s commitment to balancing tenant rights and landlord responsibilities. However, this also means tighter enforcement of California rent control laws and increased monitoring of landlord practices.
Stronger tenant protections? Advocacy groups are pushing for tighter rent controls beyond AB 1482, potentially leading to local rent control expansions in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego.
For landlords, adopting tips for efficient tenant management is essential to navigating these changes smoothly. As a property owner, you’ll need to ensure:
Legal Rent Increases Based On The Ab 1482 Rent Cap
Ensure that any rent adjustments remain within the legal limit of 5% plus local inflation, capped at 10%. Properly notify tenants of increases in advance to avoid disputes or potential penalties.
Just Cause For Issuing Eviction Notices
Evictions must be supported by legally valid reasons, such as non-payment of rent or lease violations. For no-fault evictions, landlords may need to provide relocation assistance.
Proper Documentation For Rent Adjustments And Legal Actions
Maintain thorough records of rent increases, tenant communications, and eviction notices. Accurate documentation is critical for protecting yourself during legal disputes and audits.
By mastering these areas, landlords can stay compliant and foster positive tenant relationships while protecting their investments.
