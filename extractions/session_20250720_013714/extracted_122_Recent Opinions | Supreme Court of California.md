You will find the most recent Supreme Court opinions below. The court’s opinions establish precedent that must be followed by all California appellate and superior courts. Opinions of the California Supreme Court are published in bound volumes called the Official California Reports, as well as by private publishers, in hard copy and on line.
As a further service to the public, both Supreme Court and Court of Appeal opinions are posted at the time of filing to the California Courts Web site at  https://www.courts.ca.gov/. For in-person research, the Supreme Court provides a computer terminal in its Clerk’s Office to improve public access to detailed case docket information. The terminal allows the public and the press to obtain quick and accurate information about cases before the court. Please contact the court for updated information about availability of in-person resources.
