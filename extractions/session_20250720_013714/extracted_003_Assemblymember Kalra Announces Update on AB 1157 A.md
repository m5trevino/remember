SACRAMENTO – Today, Assemblymember Kalra and co-sponsors withdrew Assembly Bill (AB) 1157, the Affordable Rent Act, from consideration. AB 1157 would strengthen tenant protections statewide by updating the Tenant Protection Act of 2019 (AB 1482) in three key ways: lowering the rent increase cap, extending tenant protections to all single-family homes, and making these safeguards permanent. “I am grateful my colleagues on the Assembly Housing Committee acknowledged the pressing need to take action to support tenants statewide and stabilize the rental market. However, the robust debate coupled with subsequent discussions with Judiciary Committee members signaled more time is needed to work on the bill,” said Assemblymember Kalra. “I am thankful to our coauthors who stand with me against the corporate landlord lobby and I am appreciative of the hard work of our passionate sponsors and diverse support coalition. As we enter an economic downturn and vulnerable Californians enter more dire financial situations, we must guide our policies with empathy for one another, especially as it pertains to keeping families in their homes. In the 4th largest economy in the world, systemic inequality continues to weigh down millions of Californians. Yet, we must keep up the fight—housing is a human right!” AB 1157 will become a two-year bill. The Affordable Rent Act aims to balance landlords' and tenants' interests by allowing modest annual rent increases while easing the financial burden on renters facing high costs in California. The bill excludes newly constructed properties in their first 15 years of occupancy to address concerns around impacts to housing development. By stabilizing the rental market, AB 1157 seeks to help families remain in their homes and enhance local economies by reducing commute times, increasing disposable income, and supporting local businesses.  The Affordable Rent Act is co-authored by Assemblymembers Mia Bonta (D-Oakland), Isaac Bryan (D-Los Angeles), Sade Elhawary (D-South Los Angeles), Robert Garcia (D-Rancho Cucamonga), Corey Jackson (D-Moreno Valley), Alex Lee (D-San José), Tina McKinnor (D-Inglewood), and Liz Ortega (D-San Leandro) and Senator Smallwood-Cuevas (D-Los Angeles). The bill is co-sponsored by the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE), Housing Now! CA, PICO California, Public Advocates, and UNITE HERE Local 11.  ### Assemblymember Ash Kalra represents California’s 25th Assembly District, which encompasses the majority of San José, including downtown and open space areas in southeast Santa Clara County. He was first elected in 2016, becoming the first Indian American to serve in the California Legislature in state history, and was re-elected to his fifth term in 2024. Assemblymember Kalra is the Chair of the Committee on Judiciary and also serves as a member on the Housing & Community Development, Labor & Employment, Natural Resources, and Utilities & Energy committees.
