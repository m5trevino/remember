Currently, 32 states recognize rent control’s counterproductive nature and prohibit it outright, preempting local governments from adopting these policies. Moreover, ten states do not impose rent regulations, having no reference to the policy in state or local laws.  
Oregon and Washington have rent control statewide but preempt it locally. Eight more states plus the District of Columbia have rent control policies in place at the state or local level. Within the minority of states that regulate rents, over 300 city or county councils have created a complex patchwork of local requirements, mostly in California, New Jersey, and New York, which consistently rank as the country’s least affordable.
