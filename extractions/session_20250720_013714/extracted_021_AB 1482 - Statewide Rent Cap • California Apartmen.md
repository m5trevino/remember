 The California Tenant Protection Act of 2019, passed as AB 1482, imposes specific rules concerning rent increases and eviction policies for many residential rental properties in California. Key provisions of the Tenant Protection Act: Rent caps: The law limits the amount by which rent can be increased annually for eligible properties. “Just cause” eviction requirements: Landlords are required to provide a valid reason for evicting tenants who have occupied a residence for more than one year. Application in rent-controlled jurisdictions: In areas with existing rent control under the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act, AB 1482 extends these rent caps to some properties not covered by local ordinances. Exemptions: Certain properties are exempt from the law, including most single-family homes and condominiums, as well as properties constructed within the last 15 years.
