The Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures for four metropolitan areas in California—Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, and San Francisco—set the maximum allowable rent increases for units subject to AB 1482 rent caps in 10 counties across the state, effective on or after August 1, 2024. However, these figures should not be used to calculate maximum allowable increases under local rent control ordinances, which may use different CPI figures than those applicable to AB 1482 increases.
The California Consumer Price Index, which determines allowable rent increases for units under AB 1482 in other parts of the state, including Sacramento and Fresno counties, is yet to be published. This figure is expected from the California Department of Industrial Relations after June 12, 2024. A regional CPI calculator will be updated once all CPI figures are available.
