Q: Does owner-occupied duplex need AB 1482 exemption notice in CA?




                I own an owner-occupied duplex in Los Angeles County, where I live in one unit and rent out the other. I have a tenant with a one-year lease ending on August 1, 2025, which will transition to a month-to-month tenancy. I need clarification on whether my property qualifies as "separately alienable property" under AB 1482, requiring an exemption notice to be sent to tenants. I missed including this notice in the lease agreement for 2024. The California Association of Apartment Owners (CAA) guidelines mention the requirement for separately alienable properties but don't specifically address duplexes. Is it too late to send the exemption notice now? Additionally, if disputes arise upon lease expiration, can I use information from the CAA to justify missing the notice? Also, where can I find official information from California State and Los Angeles County indicating whether duplexes require this notice?

																A:
								If you live in one unit of your duplex and rent out the other, your property may qualify for the exemption under AB 1482 as “separately alienable,” meaning it can be sold independently from other units. Owner-occupied duplexes generally fall under this exemption, but to benefit from it, you must give the proper notice to the tenant. Since your property appears to meet the criteria, the notice is required to officially claim that exemption from rent caps and just cause eviction rules. Even though you didn’t include the exemption notice in the original lease, it’s not too late to provide it now. AB 1482 doesn’t prevent you from asserting the exemption later, but failing to deliver the notice on time could affect your ability to rely on it during a dispute. It’s wise to give the written notice immediately—do it in writing, and keep documentation of when and how it was delivered. If a disagreement arises, you might be able to point to sources like the California Apartment Association for guidance, but courts will prioritize state law and formal notices over association materials. To get clear, official information, review the California Civil Code (Section 1946.2) and check local Los Angeles County tenant protection ordinances. These sources outline whether a duplex like yours qualifies and what procedures are required to lawfully exempt your unit.
